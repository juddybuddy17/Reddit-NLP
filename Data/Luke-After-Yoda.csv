0,1697418316.0,StarWarsTheories,"My Rewrite Pitch for the Sequels( or at least my idea of what could have been George Lucas' sequels) - There was a fascinating series of YouTube videos that encapsulated and analyzed the Star Wars saga from a dialectical perspective. In this analysis, the original trilogy represents the thesis statement of the saga, the prequels act as the antithesis, and consequently, the sequel trilogy would function as the synthesis of the saga. This three-part narrative operates within both the movies and the individual trilogies. Essentially, the sequels should have served as a merger of the two previous trilogies. Given what has been disclosed regarding George Lucas's outlines of the sequel trilogy, I feel I have a broad idea of where and what the story should be. Lucas mentioned that the third trilogy would be about the daughter and the grandchildren, meaning whereas the previous trilogies were individually dedicated to either Luke or Anakin (father and son), the sequels would focus on the journeys of two or three aforementioned characters.  
  
Leia: The most substantial storyline left unresolved by the end of the original six-part saga must be Leia’s fate following the revelation that she is Vader's daughter. Though initially intended to be a different character, due to studio interference and Lucas's exhaustion, Leia was retconned to be Luke’s sister. This knowledge, disclosed so late in the game, comes to her just as she defeats the enemy, making her realize she has the potential to become the enemy herself. How does this knowledge impact Leia during the reconstruction of the Empire? My hypothesis is that she somewhat represses it. She might train with Luke but remains hesitant. How can she forgive the man who obliterated her home planet and sent her future husband to gangsters merely because he was her father? What does this mean for her destiny? Or, more pertinently, the fate of her children? The most significant plot point I want to incorporate into my version of Episode 7 is one that was initially meant to be in the movie but was eventually adapted into the Star Wars Bloodline book, where Leia’s relationship to Vader is disclosed to the Senate, alienating her from it and sowing distrust.  
  
The grandchildren, as I see them, are twin amalgams of the previous two heroes in terms of their arcs.   
  
The Son: Regardless of whether he is named Sam, Skylar, Ben, Finn, or something else, he's the son of Han and Leia. I'm undecided as to whether he is an only child, but nevertheless, he feels solely burdened by his legacy. Like Luke, he becomes enchanted with the legends of his family, feeling he is destined for a greater purpose, and actively pursues that feeling. This time, however, he embarks on a dark path that begins and evolves on screen rather than being presented as the status quo. Like Anakin, he is discovered by a powerful Force wielder who convinces him to follow his “destiny”. But, in contrast to Qui-Gon, it’s Darth Talon. Despite the son’s dark descent, she and Maul would have been the primary antagonists of the trilogy, manipulating events, accruing power, and obliterating anything obstructing their plans. She seduces him down the dark path. Whether or not he kills Han is undecided in my scenario (Han dies regardless), but he must commit something irredeemable.  
  
In my reimagining of Episode 8, the son becomes such a problem for the New Republic that Leia is forced to freeze him in carbonite. This parallels numerous facets. Like Luke and Anakin’s parallel of losing a hand, this would be the Solo father-son parallel, with Leia acting as a reverse of Vader, symbolizing the dark deeds she must commit to restore order, while also deeply rejecting her family legacy, ironically while in a position similar to her father. This moment would be utterly heartbreaking but would justify the son’s need for vengeance and his assumption of his grandfather's persona (similarly to how Kylo Ren is a Vader copy). This leads to a moment in the final movie where Leia and the Son have a moment of atonement similar to Vader and Luke on Endor, where it was an atonement with the father, here it is an atonement with the son (and kind of also the father since he represents all the dark side and Vader of the family).  
  
The Young Girl: The primary hero, whether named Taryn, Kira, Thea, Sally, Winkie, or Rey, who was intended to be our generation’s Luke Skywalker, unfortunately, became a hollow disappointment. Torn apart by what was a gimmicky marketing move to ensure tickets would sell for both Episodes 8 and 9, her identity became a mystery box. The result was a slew of half-baked, somewhat concerning theories of her identity that utterly lost sight of its logical conclusion. Well, somewhat logical. Logically, she was most certainly Han and Leia’s daughter, or Luke’s child, right? However, it seems almost insincere story-wise for Luke to have mated with a random woman off-screen only for their daughter to be stranded on a Tatooine rip-off. This aspect of the story bothered me. If this is anyone’s child, why was she there? Why are there so many mysteries set up between two episodes when the previous saga worked seamlessly with one another in terms of answers? There seemed to be so much emphasis on having her be the most disenfranchised character in the saga so that she would have the most growth. Plus, it’s the same starting place for Luke and Anakin, desert orphan. Personally, I do like the idea of her being a nobody, but it only works if she develops the right relationship later on so that her story becomes relevant to the overarching narrative. Specifically, a father/daughter bond between her and Luke (maybe Han too so that the death has some weight to her character). But, like Luke, she goes off in search of an old Jedi master for help. In this case, she’s an amalgam of Luke and Anakin where she an orphan with no legacy (Anakin) seeking the Jedi master (Luke). Her character growth is positive, where her other half (the son) is negative. She becomes the other grandchild by means of adoption, connecting back to the imperative theme of Star Wars that is the relationships between fathers and sons (or daughters). In my head, Luke should have taken on the role of what was supposed to be Qui-Gon if he had not died, thus correcting the original wrong of the saga. Her relationship with the son could either be some sort of tragic romance or symbolic siblings, gross but yeah.  
  
Luke’s Exile and Path: Following the events of Episode 6, it seems somewhat logical that Luke would have restarted the Jedi, right? That’s what happened in the Expanded Universe (EU)? It seems like somewhat of an injustice for that to happen off-screen only for it to be destroyed by a character we have no connection with. No. In my head, Luke went through a more complicated state of turmoil. He probably traveled the galaxy learning all he could about the Jedi, possibly more about the Whills, but with this gain in knowledge also gained him disillusionment towards the Jedi. He tries to train Leia, but she is conflicted, and also far too busy with the chaos and politics of the galaxy  
  
. He probably helps out where he can, getting involved in numerous wars, and seeing the damage the Jedi have caused. He sees the value in having a connection to others, but at the same time becomes more and more worried about it as he gets older, developing somewhat of a Yoda perspective on connections to people. That is until he meets the young girl. Like Yoda, he is resistant, but she melts his heart, and he is willing to train her, becoming somewhat of a father to her.  
  
I know that this is extremely long, but I genuinely needed to get these thoughts off my chest. I had been developing them for so long that I couldn’t resist sharing them. I hope they’re somewhat useful or inspiring. Even if they’re not, it was nice to vent.

1,1697398335.0,StarWarsTheories,Imperial driods - I think that almost every single driod in star wars is a spy/operative for Sidious. Especially R2D2 in the clone wars. Every other day R2 is in the perfect spot to sabotage. Also nearly everytime Anakin needs help he  has to ask specifically for R2 to help him then its revealed that dudes right on the other side of the door or literally a foot from a panel thing to open it. The bad guys also always seem to have an awful lot of information about the good guys and where and what they are doing. There is a bunch of lil scenes through out the clone wars that really make me question the motives of driods or rather they even are aware or not that they are spies anyways. In the above scene it just one lil scene where kinda seems like R2 knew there was an assassin and lead the trooper to an ambush kinda hard to find it to be coincidence. Had a video attached idk why this sub doesnt allow video and didnt know until i already wrote this all out. I am not rewriting all that.  The scene is on the duchess ship when R2 hides in the cargo hold's shadows and jump scares a clone then the millisecond R2 turns his back and is a whole 3 feet away the clone gets assassinated and R2 somehow didnt hear the clones death gasp.

I explain them all in this video titled ""A Tribute to Star Wars"" (Based of Jschlatts a tribute to minecraft).

4,1696634407.0,StarWarsTheories,"Does anyone think if this goes well we might get Maul and Talon? - Between the Night Sisters and the cloning story lines, Maul physically coming back seems more feasible from a narrative perspective than just about any character in Star Wars.

I thought Ahsoka was really good, for a couple of reasons. Different things excelled in different episodes will be, but all in all I think it built a couple of cool threads going forward, and I like ambiguous endings with successful villains.

As long as they don’t over use resurrection with full capacities, I think the confluence of aspects like the Old Mothers, cloning, the brothers influence, etc. they could use a fan favorite like Maul to bring back better stories. I still feel like Feloni handles the material well, just my two cents."

6,1696618964.0,StarWarsTheories,"How are they going to explain away the Remnant’s power before we get to the Sequel’s - Dark Magic, zombies, cloning, beskar armor, etc. 

It appears as though to various degrees, the Remnant already has these figured out, yet in the Sequels it appears as though they have a tenuous grasp of each, at best. 


How will this be explained? Where did all of that knowledge and power go in the time between *now* and The Sequels? 

and on a somewhat separate issue — doesn’t it just make the Sequels even more lame and confusing to have them lacking all of these interesting/cool/scary story elements that existed prior in history? 

For instance the final battle in the Rise of Skywalker is going to appear even more disappointing, since it’s just against a bunch of normal dudes, relative to Heir to the Empire where they’re fighting literal dead men. 

I’m afraid that all of these attempts to “fix” the Sequels are actually going to make them appear worse in comparison to the era just prior. 

(This is coming from someone who desperately wants to see the Sequels fixed)"

8,1696459674.0,StarWarsTheories,"Ahsoka Season 2: Baylan fights Anakin in the World Between Worlds with Peridea holding the main gateway into it - Baylan is most likely looking out at something like the [monastery that was within Mortis in the Clone Wars](https://starwars.fandom.com/wiki/Mortis_monastery) , which sits atop a mountain and has a bright light at the top. It’s a different color from the one in Ahsoka, but the Mortis Gods wall mural/painting at the Jedi temple in Rebels emits a bright yellow light [when the portal is closed](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p7uEoNxtbA0) , so now it’s very much like the light Baylan sees. It’s definitely Mortis-related considering the huge Mortis god statues that point to it.

The bright light could possibly be the “main” gateway into the World Between Worlds then, as this would explain why Anakin’s force ghost was much clearer (less blue) at the end of the season, as Peridea is closer to the World Between Worlds ""source"" than anywhere in the regular Star Wars galaxy where we’ve seen Force ghosts before. We recently saw Qui-Gon’s Force ghost in the Kenobi show and it looked like a regular Force ghost, so it’s not like the VFX team for Ahsoka couldn’t recreate the iconic look for Anakin here.

So, Baylan enters the World Between Worlds seeking to become the Father, attracted to the role as he himself is a similar grey zone/middle-ground between light and dark sides. Anakin, assuming that he has already taken on the role of the Father, opposes Baylan's claim.

We could see Baylan choosing to fight Anakin for the role inside the World Between Worlds, given how determined Baylan has been the whole show to obtain this kind of power. He also isn’t fond of Anakin, as he discussed during his first duel with Ahsoka, so he may claim that Anakin isn’t worthy of such a role. Anakin would ultimately kill Baylan, perhaps utilizing both the light and dark sides of the Force as we saw between the Anakin vs. Ahsoka fight in the World Between Worlds.

Admittedly, one unanswered part of this theory is why would Baylan be called to this place if he wasn’t meant to serve it in any way. Perhaps Baylan was only eligible to be called at all because of his neutral nature."
9,1696134100.0,StarWarsTheories,Why Did Count Dooku Turn to the dark side? - In Star Wars Count Dooku turns to the dark side. (Only using cannon knowledge btw) From what we see he turns due to his distrust of both the senate and jedi order due to them pandering to corrupt politicians and bureaucrats. The final nail in the coffin was his padawan Qui-Gon Jinns death at the hands of darth maul. I explain my reasonings in the video below:  https://youtu.be/gSP2IFR6oiU
10,1696024051.0,StarWarsTheories,"[Ahsoka episodes 1-7 spoilers] What Baylon is looking for, and what Thrawn is loading onto his ship - In the finale of Rebels, right before Ezra jettisons the Chimera to Perridea, Thrawn has the Jedi Temple from Lothal on his ship. Ezra collapses it, but the rubble would still be on the ship when they get to Perridea. Thrawn has no reason to keep rubble on the ship, and it likely causes a minor increase in fuel consumption to keep that amount of stone & material on board for years, so Thrawn would be likely to dump it. 

Theoretically this could be something the Night Sisters would've been interested in back when Thrawn first got there. 

To be honest, I think Thrawn's just loading standard supplies they've gathered on Peridea, but I haven't seen the Lothal Temple brought up and I think it is a decent possibility."
11,1696019870.0,StarWarsTheories,"What Thrawn is loading onto the Chimera... - Everyone seems to think they are nightsisters/nightbrothers or reanimated stormtroopers (night troopers), but the numbers on board the ship wouldn't be enough to turn the tide of a war.

Maybe the nightsisters would be able to do it, but they don't seem very militant or very versed in martial combat, in any media, with the exception of a few characters, Maul, Savage, and Ventress all of which seem to break the ""mold"" in terms of power levels for their culture. But it's not impossible.

What if they are either clones of or reanimated Jedi that fell in the clone wars and order 66. We already know they were storing dead Jedi in locations. The way Marrok dies highly suggests he was reanimated. 60 or so Jedi slaves, single minded and under Thrawns control can do ALOT of damage. Also, Night trooper could be a subtle misdirect of Knight trooper. I know the episode in which a certain character in rebels dies is called ""Jedi Night"" which is an obvious play on words from Filoni.

And all of these projects are just results of them pushing for their real goal; being the ""somehow"" old papa Palpatine comes back. Insane clone force user or mindless zombie force user is not the body that Palpatine wants. But those bodies would still be useful. Also fits how Thrawn thinks. Turning waste into an asset or turning an enemies strength into a weakness.

On a bit of a more out there idea, maybe it is just 54 clones of them trying to make Rey or Rey's father (Palpatine Jr.) That whole scene in the sequels where she see's a bunch of herself in the reflection and the darkside version of herself could still come to pass. Could be a good narrative for her movie.

The Rey aspect is a bit of a stretch considering the time it is set in. Unless the original Rey was always a clone or some type of test tube baby. Which is also possible.

Another wild one is maybe they are Kaiburr crystals that they need to make those scary canons on those Star Destroyers in the First Order, but it seems too early story wise for that.

I haven't read any of the books since Disney turned from the EU so if anyone see's any glaring issues with anything I've said, and they have Canon info that contradicts me, I'm all ears and love talking theories :)"
12,1695902599.0,StarWarsTheories,"Morgan Elsbeth theory - Good morning,
I have a theory about Morgan Elsbeth, this theory doesn't make much sense but it came to mind.
I thought what if Morgan was Cal Kestis and Merrin's daughter? think morgan is human and has the powers of the nightsisters, and we know that the nightsisters are white skinned, but she is not, so I thought what if in the third game starring cal, cal and merrin have a daughter, that is, Morgan, and from there, as she grew up, she approached the empire and, in particular, Thrawn.
the only problem would be the age, he should be born after the events of jedi survivor (which I think takes place in 10 bby, but I don't remember) and he would have Ahsoka in her 20s but she won't be 20, and here I thought for ""justify"" the age, that is, perhaps, the third game is set a year after Jedi Survivor, when Morgan was born, from here Cal goes crazy and goes to the dark side and becomes an inquisitor, Merrin escapes to a Tatooine and Morgan he stays under the sun for a long time and here it can be justified that he seems older, after a few years, while Merrin teaches Morgan the use of the sisters' magic (and from here it would be explained why he knows how to master magic in Ahsoka) then just before thrawn goes to the other galaxy with ezra, morgan is found and brought to the empire and is indoctrinated and thus explains why she wants thrawn to return"
13,1695828303.0,StarWarsTheories,"Peridia in the Milky Way? - I'm reposting this from another sub, just want ya'lls take as well. 

If you look at the map that Morgan Elsbeth displays, the ""distant galaxy"" is a barred spiral and appears smaller than the main SW galaxy. The Milky Way is a barred spiral, offset in a somewhat, similar manner, and is physically smaller than our closest galaxy, Andromeda.  I think it's possible that, ultimately, it will be revealed that Peridia is actually in our galaxy. It would also be a neat way for us to have gained knowledge of the SW story and how humans are present both here and there.  What do you think?"
14,1695671240.0,StarWarsTheories,"Hoth wasn’t always an icy planet - 
In the old republic novel: Darth bane path of destruction (yes I know it’s not canon) in the old republic era the Sith and Jedi were at war (again). Near the end of the war the Sith leader, kaan gathered all of his Sith brother hood on a planet called russan. To meet the threat a Jedi general named hoth gathered most of the Jedi on russaan as well. After fighting each other on the planet for a while kaan becomes desperate and uses an ancient Sith ritual (provided by darth bane) called the thought bomb to kill the Jedi (it also killed all the Sith with the exception of darth bane). Jedi general hoth knew that trying to stop kaan would guarantee the deaths of whoever went with him, so he selected 99 other Jedi (no padawans) to go with him and evacuated everyone else off planet. Kaan used the thought bomb and the highly respected general hoth died. Afterwards however, the thought bomb didn’t go away it stayed there deep in the cave where it was used. From that point on anyone who got into the vicinity of the thought bomb always mentioned how it felt like it was draining the heat from the air and at one point it was mentioned that the area around it was freezing. 

So after all that back story (sorry about that but this backstory is required to understand the theory) here’s my theory: hoth used to be russan a planet full of forests and jungles, but the thought bomb, after hundreds of years drained all the heat from the planet, turning russan into an unlivable icy wasteland, the name of russan was changed to hoth out of respect for the fallen Jedi general and because russan was his final resting place."

If that is true and Abeloth is released from Peridea then there will be only one person able to stop her. Just like in the EU they will bring in Luke Skywalker who, with the help of other powerful force users, will be able to confront her.

In the final climax of the movie, Luke would have to face off against Abeloth, sacrificing himself in a fierce battle.But they would not kill him. He survives the battle and manages to contain Abeloth again but Abeloth manages to corrupt Luke Skywalker at his core.Until the point where he almost kills Ben Solo in his sleep. He realizes that he can no longer manage to successfully suppress the darkness left by Abeloth that is slowly driving him to madness, making him lose the good man he once was.

2) He has a split personality (OSDD1 or DID) due to childhood trauma as a slave. His darker personality just didn't have a name till Sideous gave him one and he rarely came out. Then after he murdered Windu, then the Vader personality took over completely till that moment in RotJ with Luke.

18,1695450113.0,StarWarsTheories,"The Few to Succeed Tarre Viszla - Throughout the most recent of series we have seen Tarre Viszla pop up more and more. His identity as a Jedi and Mandolorian being the most exciting of a factor. We know these two identities contradict each other. One values wealth and materialism, the other asceticism and peace within one's self. We also know T.V was at odds with his people as well because of this identity crisis. It's what ultimately caused him to abdicate the throne. However over the ages, T.V and his darksaber have been symbols of unity for mandolorians and interestingly jedi as well. Two factions that supposedly have been at odds since the downfall of the republic. 

The successor to Tarre Viszla has already been shown. It is either coming in the form of Grogu or Sabine Wren down the line. 

They fit the M.O to a tee. Two outlasting survivors of their clans. Two trained in the ways of the Force albeit incompletely. Two honed in the cultures of Mandalore. It is a seat that ultimately rests in Bo-Katan's hands but the history of being Mand'alor is often embroiled in traitorous plots and civil unrest as there is always a faction/clan who disapproves of the current Mand'alor's ideaologies/choices. So anything can happen. 

Another reason I believe this to be the case is the evidential alignment of goals between the Jedi and Mandalorian. Eventually, both scattered remnants will realize they need each other's help. In order to seriously defeat the empire, an alliance must be formed which realistically must take the shape of a Jedi Mandalorian. 

Lastly, having two candidates for a Mandalorian Jedi to exist at one time where one has not been seen in 1000s of years is not coincidence. "
19,1695426937.0,StarWarsTheories,"A GOOD THEORY ABOUT THE AHSOKA SHOW (please read im a prophet) - The nightsister structure on Perieda where Thrawn is at has ""Praise Kujet ruler of all, may his reign last for all"", written on it in ancient sith tounge (Some dude on twitter found out about this). Now Kujet was the leader of the force sensitive Zeffo and he fell to the darkside. What if the zeffo learnt how to ride the purrgil and Kujet found Peridea where the Dathomirians saw him as a god or messiah due to him being their first contact with an alien lifeform from another galaxy with cool ass force abilities and so they wrote things about him, calling him a ruler etc. He then taught the nightsisters how to ride the purrgil and led them to the planet of Dathomir, where they built his palace as a gift for him. Then he dies and he’s burried on the planet etc and the Zeffo fall apart. But we know that some of them fled beyond the unknown regions and Cordova said that the Zeffo trail went cold in the Outer Rim. Now why did it go cold? Because they rode the purrgils to other galaxies as a means of escape. 

Now in the newest episode Baylan mentions that he feels something powerful on the planet and he seeks to find it. He also wants to end the cycle of empires rising and falling. I think this ”powerful thing” that he’s sensing is some source of darkside power left by Kujet, maybe it’s knowledge or a holocron idk

Baylan says that if they find Thrawn, they will gain unimaginable power, this power being that source of power that he’s sensing and with this power he could destroy Thrawn’s army before it can attack the republic, ending the cycle. But maybe this power means that he’ll become a Sith and obviously Ahsoka or Ezra wouldn’t be fine with that so they’re gonna need to stop him even if that means letting Thrawn escape. Idk just a theory tho"

I feel like there is something between Shin and Sabine, the way they look at eachother, especially in Episode 5 and 6.

Before anyone says, ""but Shin tried to kill her""...have you ever watched a movie or show.

Enemies to lovers has been a concept as old as time.

I know people ship Ezra and Sabine, bit to me that feels more like a family bond, and I know not every character has a love interest.

I live how Shin is just like Baylan, they clearly aren't Sith (especially since neither were trained as one), cool concept different to the evil kill all Jedi motive.

21,1695402092.0,StarWarsTheories,"General Hux could have been a great character - His backstory should have been having his parents killed by the first order / empire so he swears to destroy it. He chooses to infiltrate it to destroy it from the inside and raise through the ranks. Yes he kills lots of people but he has no power in it. While he acts out his role as general he sabotages everything and also feeds information to the resistance. In his mind, even though he has to do awful things to not blow his cover if it wasn't him doing it someone worse may do it and be more compentant. The emotional toll of being a double agent could be an interesting dynamic. We think hes an evil maniac but at the end we learn that hes actually the good guy forced into a very bad position and without him sabotaging/feeding the resistance false information it would have failed.  
  
Palpatines clone being Reys father and a good guy could have explored innate evil as in if Palpatine never had force powers perhaps he would just be a normal guy.  
  
I thought about this perspective because I was reading up on a torturer who was only one being he believed if he didn't do it someone worse would. When General Hux says ""I'm the spy"", this is the motivaitons that should have been behind it instead of just ""I want Kylo Ren to lose"" sort of thing. I think they just added in that scene for no reason but it could have been an interesting dynamic. What do you guys think?  
  
tl;dr: General Hux was a double agent for the resistance because if he wasn't someone worse would take his position that wasn't a double agent

22,1695388205.0,StarWarsTheories,"[The Mandalorian] Omera was a Mandalorian - Theory evidence: She knew how to shoot and shoot well when no one else in the Sorgan tribe knew how to fight at all. She also just straight up asked Din how long it had been since he had taken off his helmet, which to me implies that she at least knew of that sect and its rules around helmet removal.

She did act surprised when he said he hadn’t removed it since he was a child, but not all Mandalorians followed that creed and given how both Bo Katan and Boba Fett call the children of the watch bantha fodder and fairy tales, the children of the watch was probably not a big sect. 

She also seemed to be really drawn to Din when they first met, even when she had no idea what he actually looked like. This might could be chalked up to being motherly and hospitable but I think she was able to see past the armor because she knew the type of people who wore that armor. 

My theory (and headcanon) is that she escaped the purge with her young daughter Winta but lost her husband in the great purge, and found her way to Sorgan and abandoned the Mandalorian ways of life to be a krill farmer and a normal person with a chance to raise winta on a peaceful planet."

Towards the end of the episode we actually get to see some of Thrawn’s NightTroopers transporting this cargo to the Chimaera, and they look an awful lot like coffins… which leads me to believe these are dead Dathomiri waiting to be resurrected. 

So what exactly was the agreement they made? I believe the great mothers want to travel to the main Star Wars galaxy, for the purpose of repopulating Dathomir once again, and potentially take out a larger threat at play…. more about who this threat may be later.

Why not populate Peridea? It’s clear there’s a larger threat at play in this new Galaxy, that neither the great mothers nor Thrawn want to be around any longer then they need to be. Perhaps Dathomir is a safer place to regrow and populate the Night Sisters once again, especially if they have an alliance with Thrawn, someone who can overlook and protect Dathomir. Furthermore, if Thrawn is confident he can be the next heir to the empire, and re-emerge the scattered imperial forces under his rule, then this would only interest the great mothers even more to have an alliance with such a strong empire. 

Who is this threat? I believe this would be the Grysks. We know from the Thrawn novels that the Grysks hide within the unknown regions, but they could very well originate from this new galaxy. Perhaps they have more control in this galaxy, and they’ve been scouting the SW galaxy for many years now, to plan their invasion when the moments right. If they’re the enemy of the Witches, and they’re very much an enemy to Thrawn and the Chiss, then it’s a no brainer the two would join forces and work together to regrow a strong and powerful empire, to fend off and defeat the Grysks. The enemy of my enemy is my friend. 

And what does Thrawn get? Number 1, a way to escape exile and back to the SW galaxy, and number 2, dark magic. Dark magic could be used in a number of different ways to strengthen this new empire under Thrawn’s rule, the most notable being resurrection. I also believe Thrawn’s NightTroopers were once dead stormtroopers, simply brought back to life through dark magic. This magic would work similar to Marrok, and how when he was killed, he just disintegrated into a puff of green smoke. Imagine a new empire under Thrawn’s command, with allies like the Chiss and the Witches joining forces, as well as having access to dark magic…? That sounds pretty terrifying and badass at the same time.

What are your thoughts?"

25,1695281542.0,StarWarsTheories,"Thrawn + Night Sisters = Undead Army (yuuzhan vong invasion imminent?) - This theory draws from another Filoni masterpiece, the Clone Wars series. Just to recap, Part 6 of Ashoka saw the return of Grand Admiral Thrawn and Ezra, Thrawn’s alliance with the Night Sister’s, and a glimpse into this new galaxy.

The first link is Thrawn’s stormtroopers, or Night Troopers, which I believe heavily implies that perhaps whatever is under those helmets might not be entirely human…

Thrawn allied himself with the night sister’s, a coven that is infamous for using Sith Alchemy, in order to return to the Star Wars Galaxy. While it’s been made clear why Thrawn would want to return to the galaxy, why are the night sister’s so eager to leave their home planet? Multiple characters speculate on just that question with no real guesses. So after doing some speculation of my own and here is where the theory begins…

The Yuuzhan Vong, a beta cannon species that are ruthless, powerful, and love subjugating vast swaths of the galaxy, are on the warpath. The night sister’s have foreseen the coming of the vong and have seen Thrawn’s military genius and have sided with him. They believe that he is the best hope of preventing the vong from expanding even further into the universe.

The home planet of the Night Sisters is also one of the only hyperspace connections to the galaxy and a ripe target for the Vong’s new campaign. That is why the sister’s are so eager to escape but that isn’t everything.

Thrawn does not allign himself with others unless he sees value in them, and if my theory is correct, that is precisely why Thrawn is transferring the bodies of dead night sister’s out of the planet’s crypt.

In the Clone Wars series, general Grevious is sent to Dathomir (home to a coven of Night Sisters) to wipe them out. The coven’s matriarch, mother Talsun, uses her powers to awaken their deceased night sisters from their graves to fight Grevious.

With Thrawn’s genius mind and the Sister’s ability to summon a powerful undead army, they hope to restore the empire under Thrawn and unite the galaxy’s resources against resisting the Vong.

I believe that perhaps the series will end with our heros foiling Thrawn’s plans and Thrawn will admonish them for fools and tell them of the grave threat coming to the galaxy. We probably will never truly see the invasion of the Vong and this is all just a theory but knowing what I know about the Vong, the Night Sister’s and what little we have seen so far in the show (not to mention Filoni’s knack for bringing back content from the legends timeline) this seems like a likely storyline for the show. 

Let me know what you think."

I have a theory that they know that a clock is ticking and they need to get off Peridea and soon.  

Just like Ezra & Thrawn were retconned to go to Peridea instead of the unknown regions, I think another race may be retconned to Peridea from the unknown regions, the Zeffonians.  

I think this has been foreshadowed in Bad Batch S2 as well as by the visuals used in the WbW and Ahsoka marketing in general including the series logo. The Zillo beast may have a Zeffo origin story.  

I wouldn't put it past Feloni to include the Zeffonians in Ahsoka, or at least a Zillo beast.  Anyway, just throwing that out there, mostly visual similarities but I have a feeling about this, not sure if it's good or bad though.  But I do think we're getting some hints of this.

29,1695226968.0,StarWarsTheories,"The Three Witches - Small theory !

With an episode already named 'Toil and Trouble', a presence of ghosts (Anakin), and now the three witches we're seeing a Macbeth influence in Ahsoka. Episode 6 shows Thrawn is clearly listening to the witches as Macbeth did. I think Thrawn's goals are presented by the witches and their prophecies. The Bendu, another mystical force, fought against Thrawn and foretold his later defeat. So Thrawn understands to respect these powers.  

Thrawn is also ambitious like Macbeth which will lead to his defeat. In Macbeth, the titular character seeks the witches to know how to keep his kingdom. In the end Macbeth is defeated by misinterpreting the witches' prophecy to believe he will win when it is too late. 

For Thrawn, I think Sabine will be his fatal flaw. Thinking he can't be stopped because of the witches' words, Thrawn (Macbeth) lets Sabine (Macduff) go only for her to find the way to defeat him.  Thrawn's fatal flaw his ambition leading him to misinterpret a prophecy."
30,1695187976.0,StarWarsTheories,"Ahsoka theory about the Purrgil - In Andor, an agent from the ISB explains the highly effective torture device created by the sounds of a being dying. These beings, “sentient” and “highly unusual” made a “choral, agonizing pleading” sound as they were being massacred by Imperial troops. They were natives of Dizon Fray, a moon near the outer rim, where Imperials wanted to build a fuel depot.

My theory is that these native Dizonites are actually Purrgil. Purrgil make choral sounds, and in Rebels (whether it’s Dizon Fray or another planet/moon), they’re seen hovering around a fuel depot development to “feed” on the fuel. Ezra also notes that they sound sad (agonized, one might say) when threatened.  And they’re clearly a nuisance to the Imperials stationed there, which could be a precursor to the order to deal with them by any means necessary.

I also think in Ahsoka, we’re going to see Thrawn & co try to kill Purrgil and inadvertently expose themselves to the same torturous sounds. Perhaps as the way Ahsoka & co escape??"

while watching the trailer for ahsoka i noticed that thrawn is alone on elisabeth morgan's ship, or so it seems.

36,1694909301.0,StarWarsTheories,"My Plan For How To Defeat The Rebel Alliance - We all know how the Galactic Empire met its fate, but why? How could the most powerful and professional army leave the rebels in control of the field? The answer is poor screenwriting and optimistic story telling.

&#x200B;

1. Cut off rebel weapons and equipment supplies by investigating major manufactures, finding who is supplying them, and stopping it
2. Cut off rebel financial capability to trade by hunting down and destroying the rebel fleet of smugglers or legitimate traders who are fueling the rebel war effort. Further, destroy any financial institution who is aiding the rebels.
3. Deploy the Empire's elite special forces to make targeted assassinations against the rebel alliance. Decapitate their leadership in a couple fell swoops.
4. Stop using massive capital ships for blockades and deploy smaller and faster vessels more capable of counter-insurgency and pursuit.
5. Use a network of confidential informants and spies to predict the locations of rebel forces and stop them instead of playing cat-and-mouse. Just end it, blow up the planet if you need to.

There is no reason why the Empire could not defeat the rebels. The original trilogy played on the American concept of poorly armed rebels fighting the Napoleonic British and using guerilla tactics to win. The Imperial Army wasnt using outdated tactics, they were not using tactics at all. The comparison does not match, the empire had advanced clandestine capabilities that should have crushed the rebellion in weeks."

Ok, so I know this is a long shot but here me out. There is very little lore material around what happened to Coruscant by the time the the sequels take place. We know that at some point between now and the sequels the New Republic has to move their capital to Hosnian Prime. There has been no lore explanation as to why this happened. Also at the end of episode 5 Hera has to report to Coruscant to face trial. They have also been building up Coruscant as the New Republic capital in shows like Mando. It kinda feels like a Checkov’s gun type situation. What if once Thrawn escapes the other galaxy he comes back with a plan already in place to destroy the new republic. What if during Hera’s trial while she is trying to prove Thrawns existence he just shows up and launches an attack on the planet. Capturing the capital of the new republic or damaging it in some way before the republic even knows that he is a threat and is still military week would be the exact kind of brilliant tactical decision that would give Thrawn a great first impression to new viewers, as well as setting up the Dave Fillni movie where they could possibly reuse old concepts from the original script for episode 9."

I reject the idea that Grogu will link back up with the Jedi. In fact, I don't think he'll ever take up Jedi training again. I think he's going to become the most feared bounty hunter in the Galaxy.

BUT.

Think of it from Owen and Beru's perspective.  Obi-Wan drops Anakin's child into your lap and informs them that they need to protect him from the empire.  Whether he informs them of Darth Vader's true identity is ultimately irrelevant.  Sixteen years later, and this kid just will *not* stop talking about going to the *Imperial* Academy and *JOINING* the *EMPIRE.*  Owen keeps inventing excuses to keep Luke sequestered to this po-dunk back water of a world, but he knows all too well that its only a matter of time now.  He spins up tales of how Darth Vader murdered his father and does he really want to go work for the Empire that supported that?!?  Cut to a few years later, the kid *still* won't shut up about going to the Academy, and one morning Luke tells you that there's an Imperial Star Destroyer in orbit and that its engaged in battle.  This child that you're supposed to protect from the Empire, and the Empire is closer than it has ever physically come to him before.  Owen tells Luke its nothing and to go do his chores.  *Then* that new astromech unit disappears in the night, and Luke goes running after it.  While he's gone, a squad of Storm Troopers pounds on the door.

What's your first thought?  That they're conducting a search for some missing droids and that the Jawas pointed to your address as the place they sold them?  Probably not!  They've come for Luke, and its only a matter of time before the kid bumbles on home while the Storm Troopers are there.  They'll take him away, and you will have failed to protect him.  So they either attack first, or at the very least are obstinately uncooperative.

50,1694146494.0,StarWarsTheories,"Shadows of the EU: Where Filoni is taking this story and the fate of Ezra Bridger - Dave has liked to pluck here and there from the EU. If not story lines, his work has been filled with easter eggs, nods, and a few characters reworked (even if ever so slightly) to fit the post Disney Star Wars canon. I believe we can make inferences some strong guesses based previous nods and select dialogue in an attempt to theorize where this story is going.

I'll begin with the fate of Ezra Bridger. I firmly believe he will return as an antagonist. There is no way a character can be gone for so long with no tangible hint to their whereabouts and come back a hero. The Ezra Sabine and the crew of the Ghost lost will not be the one they may finds.

Outside of guesswork based on what I believe makes for compelling narrative structure, there are a few subtle clues in the Ahsoka show that hint at Ezra's turn. When Huyang comments on Sabine's lightsaber, they refer to it as HER lightsaber. The first time we as an audience see a lightsaber pass from one owner to another is when Obi Wan gives Luke Anakin's lightsaber. An old hero's light saber passed on to a new hero who will be shocked to learn they have fallen. It's like poetry, it rhymes.

There is also what I am dubbing The Jacen red-herring. In the finale of Rebels, we learn Hera had a son by Kanan who she named Jacen. I don't know about the rest of you but my EU loving brain exploded from that hot memberberry soup they served. In retrospect, I think Hera's son's name hold more meaning. I believe they are pulling a bit of slight of hand on the views, as Hera's son being named Jacen only to distract the audience. Ezra Bridger bares far more resemblance to Jacen Solo in character traits. Jacen Solo also disappeared for a long time while being tortured by the Yuzhung Vong, a threat from another galaxy. I believe Ezra is this story's ""Jacen Solo"", a hero turned to the dark after experiencing true horror from a galaxy beyond.

Sabine's Jedi training lines up with an EU story as well. During the ""Legacy of the Force"" story line in the old EU, Jaina Solo trains with Boba Fett in the ways of the Mandalorian as a means of gaining an advantage on her fallen brother Jacen. In Ezra's last transmission sent to the Ghost crew, he tells Sabine he thinks of her as a sister. Contrasting Jacen's Jedi sister training with a Mandalorian to take him down, Ezra's surrogate sister is a Mandalorian training as a Jedi before what I believe to be an inevitable confrontation. It's like poetry, it rhymes.

I don't think he will be a Sith. I don't think he will think himself a darksider at all. He has dabbled in some dark side teachings and powers in the past. Dave doesn't seem interested in having a Sith v Jedi dynamic in the show four episodes in. Ezra will likely return as a man on a mission to right what he dubs wrong with the galaxy by what ever means necessary, challenging the ideals of the failing New Republic. Dave and co. have rather shown the fledgling New Republic's flaws across all of the series they have developed set in this time period. He likely will have really seen some things after all this time away from home and at least a portion of this time spent with Thrawn. Jacen Solo, who's story I think Ezra's arc will be inspired by, started down the dark path after he was tortured by the Vong for a year. Ezra has been gone close to ten years. Maybe he wasn't tortured, but there is no way he could have been gone for that long without it warping his perception. It is clear some kind of threat is looming in this new galaxy that Thrawn and Ezra have been in. Their influence on this story will likely be as great as Thrawn's and Ezra's.

More than looking into clues and drawing conclusions based on circumstantial evidence, let's be honest, Thrawn's Emperor needs a Vader. Thrawn as the Big Bad is about as big of a bad as a non force using opponent can get, but having a potential second in command who's identity delivers an emotional gut punch the audience and the protagonists, that is great television. Star Wars basically invented to ""secret twist"" villain identity trope back in 1980 but the franchise has not had a truly satisfying twist since.

I don't think this is purely an ""Heir to the Empire"" adaption. I think Dave and co. are drawing from multiple sources across the EU to create their on story. I think these few parallels are very intentional. I doubt there will be any beat for beat adaption in this or any future Star Wars story, bu the thought that Lucasfilm is finally embracing some source material after KK claimed it didn't exist excites me."

But Vader crushed his efforts, killed his apprentice, and left him a broken man. He stopped identifying as a Jedi not because the hunger for power drove him, but because he feels he failed a s a Jedi. "
54,1694042457.0,StarWarsTheories,Show theory - does anyone think we may get a Padme Cameo in Ashoka since Anakin was trying to save her originally? And he wants Ashoka to help him and from his perspective she disappears from their fight in rebels and palpatine knew what happened so he might be trying to change the timeline. And since that was part of the reason he went to the dark side it would add up how and why he is there and the Vader theme kinda gives it away that it's not how everything seems....if not what cameo if any do you think will happen
55,1693976435.0,StarWarsTheories,"A theory about the person at the end of Ahsoka Episode 4 - **That wasn't Anakin. That was the Mortis Son...**

I feel like there is a lot of evidence that points towards that...

1- ""Anakin"" wasn't in Force Ghost form (translucent)... Yes if they were both in Force Ghost heaven then that would make perfect sense.. but they're not.. they seem to be in the World Between Worlds. The evidence being: its the same Spaceish Skybox, ""Anakin"" and Ahsoka were standing on the same type of pathway, and the most paralleled one; Ahsoka woke up on the Pathway just like how in Rebels she woke up after being saved by Ezra..

I think what happened is that the Son has been watching Ahsoka for reasons, and when she fell off the cliff after being pushed by Baylon, she was going to die but then the Son reached through the World Between Worlds portal and ""saved her""... 

2- I feel like how the scenes were put together points to that too... i mean first off the Imperial March plays at the end.. why would that happen if that was really Light Side, Good, Force Ghost Anakin, that just doesn't make sense...

 If you think about it it kinda seems like it was filmed in a horror movie type of way. Like you know how in horror movies when the character is looking in the mirror and then a demon appears behind them. Thats sorta what ""Anakin"" felt like. (Now yes if we assume that is 100% Anakin, I think it should be shot the exact same way) but combined with other factors I think you can interpret it as horrorish.
 
Second, the dialogue is weird (in an ominous way), like he says ""I didnt expect to see you so soon"". Now yeah i mean what are you even supposed to say and maybe its true that he didnt, but youd think it would be more warmer like ""Ive missed you so much etc""

So I think how it was really said is ""I didnt expect to see you so soon, I can finally get my revenge"".

Third, when Ahsoka looks at him, theres a stark contrast between their smiles. It seems like Ahsoka is genuinely smiling and happy. But it seems like ""Anakin"" is faking it. And him just standing there not talking gives vibes of when in horror movies theres a character not moving, and then when their name is called and they're stared at long enough— all of a sudden their face starts morphing, such as it starts melting and then bugs crawl out of their eye sockets or something. 

So I think what is gonna happen in Episode 5 is: a few seconds of the scene we already saw is gonna play —her staring at ""Anakin"", then the music is gonna become Dark and ""Anakin"" is gonna transform into Darth Vader and then into the Son.

3- Think about it too, Ahsoka seeing force Ghost Anakin for the first time is such a finale type of thing; like in the finale of Kenobi. Its not an Episode 4 thing. In the middle of a story there needs to be conflict, not resolution. Her seeing the real Anakin is a resolution.. ""Anakin"" being the Son is the conflict that you would expect half way in a story. 

So I think in the final episode we are going to see the real Anakin in Force Ghost form sorta as her ""reward"" for doing everything she needed to do. Like in Kenobi how Obi-Wan couldn't see Qui Gon because he ""wasn't ready yet""; he had inner conflict... but when he finally solved his inner conflict, he got to see Qui Gon.

The End.

Edit: More evidence is that Sam Witwer, a person who is credited in this TV show, is the voice actor of the Son.

Edit2: There's a supposed leak that >!Anakin and Ahsoka will fight eachother on Mustafar!< and so I think how Episode 5 is actually going to go down is that ""Anakin's"" eyes are going to turn Sith Yellow, and then he is going to pull out his Lightsaber and start chasing Ahsoka, and theyre going to be jumping in and out of portals, and one of those portals is going to be to >!Mustafar where they will fight.!< And then at some point ""Anakin"" will transform into and reveal themselves as the Son."

58,1693609728.0,StarWarsTheories,"Marrock is a Clone, but not just any Clone? - This is more of a ""hopeful"" theory as I just don't think Lucasfilm has the foresight to pull something like this off. So here goes....Apologies if someone has already posted this theory (I haven't seen it yet) but I think Marrok is going to be played by Hayden Christensen. After watching EP3 of Ahsoka I had a crazy idea. I was thinking of the Thrawn books and how Luke had to deal with an evil clone of himself. Cloning obviously being a major part of Star Wars lore and history, why not incorporate it more into the Mando-Age. So it was already announced that Hayden would be returning in Ahsoka. I think everyone just assumes as a Force Ghost or Flashback. But what if they actually bring back Hayden as a full time cast member as a experimental clone of Anakin Skywalker himself. Ahsoka then would discover this during a fight and have to deal with the ramifications of seeing her former master again. A story line could be dedicated to bringing the clone back to the light side. He wouldn't even need to be called ""Anakin"". Just like the Clones during the Clone Wars, they all had their own identities and personalities. This could be the same for Anakin's clone. The fun part of this could be bringing Hayden back to Star Wars to essentially play a different complex character. Talk about an OH CRAP moment! Ahsoka with an uppercut of her lightsaber cuts Marrok's helmet in half to reveal Anakin's face.....Thoughts??"
59,1693589294.0,StarWarsTheories,"The one *sorta* far-fetched theory on who Marrok is that I haven’t heard yet - So we’ve all heard the possible theories on who Marrok could be, with the primary suspects being Ezra, Barriss, and Starkiller. Personally, I don’t see how Ezra could be Marrok given that he’s in another galaxy with Thrawn. As for the other two theories, I think Marrok being Barriss is still unlikely, however, due to the fact that Marrok has a very deep male voice, I think that could just be a red herring to cover up Barriss’ identity (similar to the Enfys Nest twist in Solo). I think there is a decent amount of evidence pointing towards Marrok at least being PLAYED by Sam Witwer when his mask comes off, but if Starkiller were to appear he would be retconned.

This leaves me with one other possibility, which I started to think about when I remembered that the nightsisters have the ability to resurrect their own from the dead (to some extent). The Norse myth goes that Marrok was a former knight turned into a werewolf by a witch named Morgan, and that got me thinking which (former) Jedi Knight that we know of was enhanced by night sister magic before? Before I go any further, this theory treats everything in the Dark Disciple novel as cannon (or as much as the Ahsoka novel is).

So, yes, what if Marrok is a ressurected/zombified Asajj Ventress? After all, Ventress did fall back to her Jedi knight roots right before she was killed by Count Dooku, AND she was buried on Dathomir, which Morgan Elsbeth could have gone to after the Clone Wars while Maul was in exile.

The question still is, why? Well if the empire ran out of inquisitors by the time Thrawn encountered the rebels, maybe Morgan promised the empire a new one that would always be loyal to her, and she gave them a new name so Baylan wouldn’t recognize the former sith assassin. I would also point out that Ventress is no stranger to mercenary work, much like Marrok seems to be. The show seems to be pointing towards Marrok being from Ahsoka’s past, and what better person to choose than the first person she ever fought against? It would be interesting to see what Ahsoka would bro if she saw her once-former ally under Morgan’s control and if she could find a way to help her, or just put her out of her misery.

I still think Marrok is going to end up being Galen or Barriss, but it would be cool if this ends up being true."

Some tragedy would have taken place to cause Baylan’s wife to die causing him to take revenge and embarrass the dark side. In order to ensure no one could hurt him or his daughter he’d train her to wield the dark side.

62,1693272380.0,StarWarsTheories,"The Inquisitor Marrok and the Arthurian Legend - As has been mentioned [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/ahsokatano/comments/15zr3au/sir_marrok_a_tale_of_the_days_of_king_arthur_1902/) the Inquisitor Marrok was likely inspired by an Arthurian legend. In Le Morte d'Arthur by Sir Thomas Malory, Sir Marrok is mentioned as a bodyguard of King Arthur:

>Sir Marrok, the good knight that was betrayed with his wife, for she made him seven years a werewolf

The historian Allen French wrote a whole book, [Sir Marrok: A Tale of the Days of King Arthur](https://www.google.com/books/edition/Sir_Marrok/9KYEAQAAIAAJ?hl=en&gbpv=1&printsec=frontcover), inspired by this single sentence. The jist is that Marrok's wife (who is a lacky for the witch Morgan le Fay) transforms him into a wolf and binds the spell to a talisman, and he's freed once it's destroyed.

Given Dave Filoni's affinity to wolves, and how Marrok looks like a knight, shares his name and works for a witch named Morgan, there's no way that this is a coincidence.

Anyways, my theory is that Marrok is a Jedi who is forced to do Morgan's behest because he is either [possessed](https://starwars.fandom.com/wiki/Possession), or alternatively, controlled using a [AJ\^6 cyborg construct](https://starwars.fandom.com/wiki/AJ%5E6_cyborg_construct), like the one used on Lobot or Echo. The red lights on the temples Marrok's helmet are reminiscent to the ones on a construct, although these are most likely just there to look cool. Either of these explanations would explain why we haven't yet >!heard Marrok speak!<. Perhaps he will finally be freed once his ""talisman"" is destroyed.

EDIT: >! I just watched episode 3 and we finally got to hear Marrok speak. Marrok saying ""as you wish"" to Shin, as well as Baylan having said ""Marrok will do as he's told"" in the last episode, really makes it clear that Marrok is their lapdog. Thus far, he's been devoid of any will or opinions of his own.!< The red lights on his temples were much more noticeable in this episode, which increases the chances he's wearing a construct imo."
63,1693154579.0,StarWarsTheories,"A rather crazy and very rough outline for a show/fanfic taking place from a CIS-POV of the Clone Wars, and then a sequel branching off into an alternate timeline where the Confederacy would eventually return. Don't really know what'd be a good theme song or title for either of them. - The first show would be set in the Clone Wars, taking place over at least 5 Seasons, and would deal with several things that'd either be eventually wrapped up in the timeline where everyone dies as the Empire rises, or left to be eventually dealt with later in the timeline where the Confederacy rebuilds.

Main Characters

Primary Protagonist

Evan Wallace, a Confederacy Captain who served in Onderon's Defence Forces for eight years before joining the CIS. He doesn't wipe his Droids of their memories, and encourages them to develop because he believes freedom is the right of all sentient beings, a category which he believes Droids fall under. Wears a rather bulky suit of armour coloured emerald green and blood red. Human, male, 24. White skin, brown hair cut short, greyish-blue eyes.

Secondary Protagonists

Lilla Dystraay, a Confederacy Captain who was Evan's best friend on Onderon for years. They joined the CIS Navy together. She wears a more sleek, smaller version of Evan's own armour with a similar paintjob. Commands a Munificent, the Infinity, a ship in Evan's Squadron. Human, female, 24. White skin, brownish-red hair cut to her shoulders. Is extremely loyal to Evan, with their relationship sorta mirroring that of Roy and Riza in Fullmetal Alchemist in terms of healthiness and loyalty.

Kuvila Waree. A Jedi Padawan who would've defected to the Confederacy after seeing just how far the Republic was willing to go for victory. Zeltron, female, 16.

Honorius. A Vulture Droid that hadn't been mind wiped in years and developed a personality of it's own. Taking the name Honorius, his loyalty is to his Captain first, and then the Confederacy.

Odantus. A Tactical Droid who would be an early prototype for the Super Tactical Droids that developed his own personality. Serves as the First Officer of the Spear.

Main Ship

Spear Of Hope, a variant of the Providence Class Dreadnought, 4500 meters long, and the flagship of Drake Squadron. The aft tower has been shortened and now sits only three decks above the hull. This space, and three decks down, has been modified for the production, storage, and launch of hundreds of Proton Torpedoes and dozens of Droids. Beneath the bridge is the barrel of a massive Mass Accelerator firing Particle Disintegrator Warheads. While not as powerful as the type used by the Empire's Galaxy Gun, it is still a major threat. Dooku chose to keep the ship secret as an ace in the hole.

(First show, still can't decide on title. Maybe Star Wars: Fires Of Hope?)

Season 1: The first episode would take us to Raxus, where Evan is being ordered to take his Squadron to Sedronak. A gas giant used to mine Tibanna much like Bespin, with a capital city that is designed closer to a five-armed snowflake. The planet had originally declared neutrality, only to be invaded by a Republic force of 1 Venator and 2 Arquitens. The Governor then sent a desperate cry to the Confederacy for aid.

The Venator is under the command of Admiral Jonspar Adaran. He orders his clones to execute half of the younger civilians, then bolt the other half to their LAAT's to act as meat shields, and this is the order they are about to carry out when the Vultures and Hyenas engage the Republic defenses. Honorius lands to engage an AT-TE directly, destroying it and saving a group of civilians.

The Spear jumps into orbit and engages the Venator, using it's torpedoes to take out the Arquitens in the first volley. Infinity and the other two Munificents drop out of Hyperspace closer to the planet and move to take the city.

As his ship receives damage, Adaran orders a collision course for the city. Not wanting to risk civilian lives, the Spear rams the Venator in an attempt to physically throw it off course. Combined with the fighter squadrons and escorts throwing everything they had into it's engines along with a number of secondary explosions, the Venator flies past the city and is crushed by the gas giants gravity well.

The rest of this season would concentrate on various battles, with Evan and Lilla pining for each other but choosing to remain friends until the war is over. Most of the time Drake Squadron will act as part of a much, much larger Fleet.

A major character arc of this season would be Captain Boll agonizing over the morality of this war, of how the Clones are basically child soldiers. When he tries to argue for efforts to capture the Clones en masse and teach them of something other than war, he is shut down. Reluctantly, he agrees to cease inquiries and decides to grant them as quick a death as he can.

Season 2: This season would introduce one of the main antagonists, the Jedi General Foala Jabimm. Sent to conquer several planets, neutral and Confederacy alike, he would bring his Padawan Kuvila with him. After several defeats, Jabimm would make the decision to deploy the Red Phage, one of the precursors of the Black Wing virus, on several worlds which produce most of the food for the Mid-Rim and Outer Rim worlds. The virus was designed by Republic scientists so the younger the being, the more agonizing their death.

Drake Squadron is ordered to intercept him. When she develops a conscience, Kuvila steals several crates of the vaccine and a shuttle, and then ends up running into the Spear. After handing over the vaccine, she is placed under guard and instructed to find out where the Red Phage was developed.

One of the character development arcs would involve Honorius questioning the war after a Clone Ace Pilot manages to dodge his missile and force it into a civilian transport, part of a convoy the Clones were ordered to destroy. He'd later take it as an opportunity to steel his resolve and hunt down the Clone Pilot, destroying him and saving several more transports.

In the finale of this season, the space station where the Red Phage virus was developed and continues to be produced is destroyed. This results in Evan being promoted to Commodore and placed under the direct command of General Sev'raance Taan, a Chiss from the Unknown Regions. For her actions in stopping the Red Phage, Kuvila is recruited as a Lieutenant in the Confederacy Navy and assigned to the Spear.

Season 3: Instead of dying in mid-way through the War like in both Legends and Canon, General Taan is saved by the actions of Drake Squadron. She orders them to hunt down General Jabimm and his flagship, adding 2 Recusants and another 3 Munificents to the Squadron. As the war drags on, Evan grows a short beard, much to Lilla's enjoyment.

During the course of the hunt, the crew of the Spear develop and utilize a new weapon that doesn't use Tibanna Gas. Firing an orange-red bolt of antiproton particles, the new Combivars are extremely effective in the field. Around halfway through the season, they catch up to their prey, but he's aboard a Republic space station that caters more toward the underside of the galaxy. As such, Commodore Boll and Captain Dystraay take Lieutenant Kuvila with them on an infiltration mission. The only weapons they can bring are Kuvila's Lightsaber and three Combivar Pistols.

During the season there will be references to Project Bolthole, and it's apparent failure.

When they find the General, his Clones are quickly dispatched with the Commander being stunned by Kuvila. Seeing that taking him alive isn't an option when Jabimm is about to kill Lilla, Evan fires his Pistol. Blocking it with his Lightsaber, the General is vaporized when the Kyber Crystal explodes due to a feedback loop caused by the antiproton particles.

Count Dooku, on the orders of Palpatine, gives the order for all Combivar Weapons to be destroyed and any further research forbidden. Sensing something is amiss the crew of the Spear make copies of all their data before destroying their weapons.

During their time on the station, Kuvila will see what the people in the Core Worlds try to ignore about the Republic and her loyalty to the Confederacy will increase.

Over time Kuvila becomes a trusted member of the Spear's crew. Despite their earlier promise, Evan and Lilla grow closer anyway. Especially once they try to find Kuvila's parents, only to learn that they'd tried to stop the Jedi from taking her and were executed. Evan and Lilla more or less unofficially adopt her after that.

One of the major character arcs that would take up most of the rest of this season would be the Droids, mostly Odantus and Honorius, doing more exploration in the meaning of life. In what differentiates them from organics, and in how many of them really aren't any different from the Clones.

Season 4: Senator Mina Bonteri and her faction in the Senate begin to make moves for a peace accord. In addition, Jedi Commander Irak Wallace is sent to hunt down Drake Squadron. Evan is shaken when the younger brother he'd thought dead reappears and is trying to kill him. Unfortunately, Irak has been heavily indoctrinated by the Jedi and no longer recognizes the blood bonds between them.

Most of this season is spent trying to get Irak to stand down and defect, while in the background Project Fire Seed is mentioned through missions to defend vital installations and valuable cargo runs. In addition, Lilla and Evan eventually get married. Irak interrupts their honeymoon and Evan is forced to kill his brother in defense of his wife.

At one point, they get the designs of the ShadowBlade Stealth Corvette, which in canon was never deployed between its first appearance near the beginning of the war and its second during the final weeks. They make improvements which culminate in a ship called the Striker, and at several points use it in place of the Spear or the rest of Drake Squadron.

In the season finale, news of Senator Bonteris death hits during Iraks funeral. While none of them knew her personally, the crew of Drake Squadron know peace just became a lot closer to impossible.

Season 5: This season would mostly be about the Squadron trying to hold on as Palpatine and Dooku begin the final stages in the creation of the Empire. Taan would begin Project Exodus, which aims to ensure the continuation of the Confederacy in the event of Republic victory. The Infinity will be destroyed mid-way through this season, and Lilla will move to the Spear.

Over the course of the season, General Taan is killed and Evan is promoted to Admiral. Thus, he adds another 16 Munificents, 2 Providences, 2 Lucrehulks, and 2 Recusants to Drake Squadron. One of the many more minor characters we glimpse include Confederacy Lieutenant Jan Dodonna, who becomes a friend of Kuvila. When Order 66 begins, the Droids of Drake Squadron ignore the shut down order.

Finally realizing the major threat of the Spear, a large Imperial Fleet is sent to destroy it. At this point, the show will have two versions of the finale. One will have Project Exodus fail and everyone dies, with the Spear crashing into a Republic Mandator and destroying it when it's reactor overloads along with the remaining Particle Disintegrator Warheads. Years later Dodonna, now a Rebel Alliance General, raises a toast in their honor after the Death Star is destroyed. The other will show Confederacy reinforcements arrive from Bolthole in the nick of time, all equipped with their own Mass Drivers, annihilate the Republic fleet, then leave ""proof"" of the Spear's destruction allowing them to tow it back to Bolthole for repairs.

The second version ends with a slightly hopeful tune as Evan and Lilla, with their newborn son in her arms, gaze out the window to see a massive Confederate Fleet under construction. Behind them, a Star Map shows Imperial, Confederate Holdout, and Rebel positions throughout the galaxy, and now Admiral Taan, who faked her death in this timeline, putting together the beginnings of a plan to bring the Empire down.

(Second show, maybe titled Star Wars: Rebirth Of Hope or something? Theme would would go from dark to hopeful as the show progressed.)

Season 1: It'd start out with a pilot episode that would detail the three major changes. First, Project Bolthole would have succeeded in locating a safe fallback point in the Unknown Regions. Second, Project Fire Seed would've resulted in the creation of Factory Seeds which use Nanites to convert large asteroids into 100 kilometer tall mobile Factory Stations inside of a month. Just one station could produce and service 1 Million ships per month. The third change would obviously be the success of Project Exodus, the resulting survival of Taan, and the survival of Evan and his crew.

The first real episode would take us back to Sedronak, this time under Imperial control, five or ten years after the Confederacy's Exile. We'd see an older version of the civilians saved by the Droids in the first show being harassed by Stormtroopers. Right as the Troopers decide to just gun them down, explosions are heard and what look very similar to Confederacy Vultures, Tri-Fighters, and Hyenas, except bigger, better armed, and faster than before, obliterate the TIE fighters overhead. When the TIEs try to fight back, they are horrified to learn that all the Droid Fighters have defense shields.

We then switch to orbit, where a Venator class under the command of Captain Dominic Adaran, son of the Republic Admiral who died in the first episode of the previous series, suddenly comes under attack by four ships that greatly resemble Munificents, except built specifically for war. Then the Spear Of Hope, much bigger and looking like it'd come out of the Foundry all over again, drops out of Hyperspace.

With his ship critically damaged, Adaran orders a collision course set with the city. Once again, the Spear rams an enemy ship in the skies above, it's now 5-layer shields easily withstanding such an act, and the Imperial Venator falls into the planet where it gets crushed by gravity.

After this, they'd mostly use hit and run tactics along with the deployment of multiple ShadowBlade Stealth Corvettes. Eventually, the Empire begins allocating more resources to contain it. Including Grand Admiral Thrawn. At this point, Admiral Sev'raance Taan will reveal herself and engage her old idol in battle. Eventually, superior Confederate technology and the myriad of new tactics which Taan, remembering that space is 3-D, has developed allow her to take Thrawn prisoner.

The season would end with the Confederacy retaking Raxus, and being welcomed with opened arms after they've obliterated any Imperial forces who didn't surrender the moment 4 Million CIS warships of varying tonnage dropped out of Hyperspace. One of the new technologies they bring from exile are the Matter Synthesizers, which use any form of energy, solar, heat, whatever, to create anything you need. From food and clothing to medicine and starship parts.

Season 2: The Confederacy has retaken their old territory and begun to make inroads into former Republic space. The Empire is sending increasingly larger forces after them, and despite a few minor losses the Confederacy is slowly winning. Lilla will eventually be elected as the new President of the Confederacy. With her new position, Lilla begins growing her hair out and tying it into a braid, much to the interest of her children and, in another way, her husband.

In several scenes we see Confederacy Forces use Ysalamiri, or devices that mimic their Null Force Bubbles, to kill or ambush and capture Inquisitors.

Season 3: Most of this season would concentrate on the more political side of things as the Confederacy tries to avoid becoming no better than the Empire or the Republic. They must also navigate a treacherous road with the Rebel Alliance as people like Mon Mothma try to force them to conform to their own view. We also concentrate on Kuvila, who is trying to build a new Order of Force Users, one that is not beholden to the Dark Side like the Sith or taught to ignore their emotions to the point of being at least borderline sociopaths like the Jedi.

Darth Vader is captured by the Confederacy and interrogated by Ahsoka Tano, who has joined the Confederacy Office Of Naval Intelligence. Still haven't decided what happens to him after that. Maybe he gets turned back into Anakin Skywalker when Obi-Wan, Luke, and Leia seek to talk to him after years in prison, maybe not.

In all of this, we also see Evan and Lilla introduce their children to their parents. These interactions will serve to provide a little more hope for a better future in the grim darkness of the Empire.

In the end, Mon Mothma and what remains of the Rebel Alliance do not agree with the Confederacy, or the people who left to rejoin it, but are willing to work with them. For now.

Season 4: The Confederacy will learn about the Death Star, and begin efforts to hunt it down. In the background several arcs will deal with the Rebel Alliance and other factions slowly integrating into the Confederacy, seeing the future President Wallace presented as the best hope for the galaxy. While some, such as Mon Mothma, will want to return to the Republic, many understand that it was a failed state.

As things grow worse for them, the Empire deploys such things as the Black Wing virus. The vaccine for the Red Phage is used as a basis after retrieving scans of the Black Wing, and a cure is found. But not before several planets become zombified hellscapes.

At one point, the Empire uses the Galaxy Gun to destroy Nar Shaddaa, which was holding all the major Hutt Leaders for a summit. Both the Empire and the Confederacy move to secure key systems in their former territory, though the latter prefers solely to secure free passage while leaving the locals alone. With Hutt territory secured the Empire would've been able to attack Confederacy space from almost all sides. Admiral Wallace tracks down and destroys the Galaxy Gun.

Despite being years from functionality, the Death Star, along with the Maw Installation, is destroyed during a long range bombardment from the CIS Navy.

In the end, the Empire is destroyed. The last of the Imperial Navy mutinies when the Emperor has Coruscant's Defence Grid turned on the planet rather than surrender. Palpatine dies when his ship is intercepted by the Confederacy Navy, former Imperial warships, and several others during his escape.

The Rebel Alliance tries to make a claim on Coruscant, and though admiral Wallace withdraws peacefully they ultimately find little support. Many of the worlds which support them either end up neutral or join the Confederacy, as does the Rebel Alliance over the next two years.

After the war is ended, the galaxy begins to quiet down, Lilla steps down as President to spend more time with her husband and children, and parts of the Spear are transformed into a mobile home for the Wallace family. Though there are still threats, most of them are inconsequential and easily dealt with by the local PDF's. Despite this, every Sector has a large Confederacy Fleet ready to jump in when needed. With the Matter Synthesizers allowing people to simply create whatever they need from pure energy, money is no longer a true concern for anyone.

Droids and Clones alike are granted the same rights and freedoms as any other sentient being, and most of the Confederacy's Droids choose to stay in service. The modular nature of Confederacy ships is made useful again as they travel around rebuilding and upgrading planets across the galaxy, making the lives of everyone better.

The Confederacy has won, and for most the Empire is but a bad memory.

In this timeline.

But in the remains of the Maw Installation lies an Imperial experiment which has opened a rift in time and space. Nobody knows where, or when, it leads.

In an after credits scene, two warships emerge. One, an Imperial Super Star Destroyer under Imperial Admiral Irak Wallace. The other, the Republic Star Destroyer Spear Of Hope, a vessel which resembles a more advanced hybrid of a Venator and an ISD. Both ships are met by Drake Squadron at the head of a massive fleet of varied design, all flying the Confederacy's flag, ever ready to defend their home."

65,1692988261.0,StarWarsTheories,"Do you think Sabine and Ezra will get together? - So... do you think Sabine and Ezra will get together? Yes, Ezra says she's ""like a sister"" to him in his message, but that could change, especially since they haven't seen each other in awhile.
Sabine is acting like she's lost a lover, the way she's been grieving for a decade and apparently unable to move on. Her feelings could just be platonic, but such a strong platonic bond is extremely rare. 

I think it could go either way, but imo there's such a good potential romance set up here that it would be a waste to not capitalize on it, especially given the painfully stupid romances we've been subjected to in this franchise.

66,1692981900.0,StarWarsTheories,"Marrok. - Since everyone seems to have Marrok pegged as either Ezra, Starkiller, Cal Kestis, or a clone of Luke, I wanted to try to think outside of the box a bit.

Since Rebels has gone from an animated show, to basically live action save for Zeb and Chopper, I would think getting all possible characters represented from the show to the next type of media would be a goal more or less. Which brings me to my next thought.

What if Marrok is actually a clone of Kanan Jarrus. I hesitate to say it's actually him considering the explosion, but he was captured at one point by the empire and it would have been a simple matter to steal his DNA at that point.

It would set up a huge story line between him and Hera/Jacen and the rest of the Ghost crew with, with possible spin off potential in a live action season of Rebels, or continue on as a sub plot of Ahsoka. 

I get how people might see that as cheapening his sacrifice, especially if he actually survived and is not a clone. But I feel the story depth potential would be far greater then any of the previous choices people have been throwing around."
67,1692893055.0,StarWarsTheories,"So about the holomap in Ahsoka... - Aside from being a very similar story beat to the map to Luke Skywalker from Episode VII, the map leading to Thrawn in Ahsoka has also rendered some fan criticism regarding its logic. The fact that it displays another Galaxy haven't really been complained by anyone from what I've seen (even though the extra-galactic barrier was supposed to exist but it's hinted Thrawn is knowlegdeable in many things that are occult to the rest of the Galaxy) but the biggest problem fans seem to have with the map is the fact that it's seemingly ancient, hidden on some Nightsister world, and yet it reveals the whereabouts of a person who hasn't been missing for long. In fact, Thrawn and Ezra disappeared about nine years before the events of this show.

Ok, so we have two possibilities here: either Thrawn and Elsbeth have been in extra-galactic contact somehow (possibly through the Purrgil) and she used some very old Nightsister relic as a Holocron to register his location for herself, ORR and here's my theory: this 'relic' actually comes from the far future (millions of years into the future to be precise) and Ahsoka will involve time-travel. Now, hear me out.

Ahsoka has a deep connection to the World between Worlds as seen in Rebels, and that show even having ventured on a completely new ground for Star Wars did it so masterfully in my opinion and Ahsoka's own show could be continuing on this. Since Peridea is a whole other Galaxy there could be powers way beyond the comprehension of the denizens of the 'main' Galaxy. There could be rifts and cracks in time that could allow this device to travel in space and time, revealing Thrawn's exact location sent by himself from the future via intergalactic means. Also hinted by Elsbeth's own ""Thrawn calls to me across time and space"" .

So, what do you think? Don't know I'm into some tinfoil hat stuff here but who knows."

Did anyone else think that Sabines most recent paint job on her helmet and armor was very derivative of Revan's mask? I tried combing through older images of her helmets iterations and paint jobs and she normally retains a lot of the nite owl patterns or Ahsoka's Owl. In the show this time, it seems like there's less line work that form the owl eyes, and it's very much Revan's color scheme of steel gray, gunsteel Grey, and rusty crimson. 


They've been planting KoTOR eggs in all kinds of media the past few years and seem to gradually be setting up for a canonical confirmation of Revan, and with him being another link between Jedi and Mandalorians along with Tarre Viszla, I wonder if Sabine learned of his story and decided to take on his colors?"

I've been re-listening to the Ascendancy Trilogy ahead of ""Ahsoka"". My favorite part about the series is the expanded lore surrounding the Chiss culture and the many families within it.

One thing you're left realizing at the end of both the Ascendancy Trilogy and the Canon Thrawn Trilogy is that the Chiss are on the verge of Civil War due to the amount of political in-fighting, as well as facing existential threats from the Chaos. 

With us having most recently left Eli Vanto as having been promoted to Lt.Commander in ""Thrawn: Treason"", it's clear he is becoming more accepted within the ranks of the Expansionary Defense Fleet, as well as comfortable within the culture. I thought perhaps there was a possibility that he could be brought in by one of the families as a Merit Adoptive. If not by one of the Nine, then by one the 40 at least. 

Furthermore, with the Chiss families so concerned about glory and prestige, his role in the victory over the Grysks could certainly bolster his case for acceptance. There would also be his knowledge of the Empire and ""Lesser Space"". 

Personally, I could see him being brought in by the Stybla for the purpose of working with the UAG. His analytical skills are after all why Thrawn recruited him to join the Ascendancy. As well, since the Stybla have no allies or rivals, it would make the most sense in terms of garnering protection, while also staying out of Chiss politics for as long as possible."

https://youtu.be/J_1EXWNETiI&t=1m40s

You see Sabine raising her hand up like she is trying to use the force. In another post on this subreddit OP is saying that this is evidence that she is force sensitive. I think it's actually the exact the opposite because if you LISTEN to the clip, the Dark Jedi girl (Shin) says to Sabine, ""You have no power"". As in she doesn't have any force powers. 

Now it could just be a figure of speech, as in she does have powers but very very weak. 

But I think she really doesn't because my 2nd piece of evidence is an explanation for how Shin didn't notice and thus wouldn't bothering trying to use force powers on Sabine..

If you freeze the clip at this part (0:22) https://youtu.be/AfzJQr_7ffs&t=0m21s you'll notice Ahsoka in the background of the fight between Sabine and Shin.  

Which makes me think the reason Shin doesn't realize Sabine isn't force sensitive at first is because Shin is in fact feeling a ""force aura"" for a lack of a better term, but the force aura is coming from Ahsoka or the Inquistor Ahsoka is fighting, not from Sabine. Shin doesn't realize it's not coming from Sabine, whom Shin is probably assuming is force sensitive due to the fact that Sabine is using a lightsaber. 

Then for some reason Sabine is desperate and so she tries to use the force to save herself which is when Shin realizes she doesn't have any force powers because Sabine raising her hand isn't doing anything. 

My 3rd piece of evidence is that the trailer is called ""Trick"" and Ahsoka asks Sabine if she knows any more tricks.

The trick that the title is alluding to being that they are going to trick the Dark Siders into thinking Sabine has force powers.

86,1689141331.0,StarWarsTheories,"Signs Sabine is force sensitive--but her force sensitivity is atypical - With the release of the most recent Ahsoka trailer, I keep hearing people say, ""But she's not force sensitive...?"" However, there are subtle signs she's force sensitive in Rebels, especially in the last season.

She has this knack for knowing stuff she shouldn't know. For instance, it was her, not Ezra, that knew how to open the door to the world between worlds (something that the Empire had been attempting for months), and then how to destroy it. Ezra mentions in that same scene how both a master and an apprentice are required to access a temple, and both of the temples seen prior to that required two force sensitives to be opened. She also oddly knows precisely when Ezra is heading back to the temple door, which she should have no way of knowing. Now all of this could just be the result of a hand wavy plot, but seeing as Dave Filoni wrote and co-directed these episodes I think these details are intentional.

I think that Sabine is force sensitive, but that her connection to the force is different from the typical Jedi's, and entails having premonitions and scholarly knowledge, much like the Pathfinders of the Navigator's guild, rather than the ability to move objects with the force like a Jedi Knight. This would also fit nicely with a Mandalorian's talents for navigating the galaxy. Who knows? Maybe Sabine will be the key to finding the path to Thrawn/Ezra.

EDIT: Also, I didn't notice this on my first time watching the trailer, but Sabine raises her hand as though to use the force. To even attempt to use the force is odd if she hasn't had any formal training.

EDIT 2: Here are other subtle signs/foreshadowing of Sabine's (alleged) connection to the force that I hadn't noticed the first time I watched it:

1. Sabine has a convor on her shoulder armor (a symbol of the light side and ""force familiar"" that accompanies Ahsoka wherever she goes).
2. the way the Bendu watches her after she kicks him and walks away (Trials of the Darksaber).
3. Force theme plays when she spares Gar Saxon's life after disarming him (a clear allusion to Anakin disarming and executing Dooku). ""That may be the Mandalorian way. But it's not my way."" Sabine chose the Jedi way, unlike Anakin.
4. Sabine hears voices when traveling by Loth Wolf but Zeb apparently doesn't. This is in the same episode that she assists Ezra in opening the temple (Wolves and a Door)."

Being deemed the chosen one as a child and the strongest force user of all time, Palpatine immediately recognized Anakin would be his ultimate weapon. Sith apprentices are always trying to kill their master, but an inhibitor chip is by far the best way to ensure obedience. Palpatine was close to Anakin since he was 9 years old so he and the kaminoans had plenty of time to figure it out. We know from Bad Batch that the inhibitor chip wears off on the clones. Anakin might've had a special inhibitor chip different from the clones and therefore caused slightly different behavior and longterm effects. It might've worn off by the original trilogy, but by then his brain was still screwed up from the chip and he still needed Luke to break free. Remember Palpatine wasn't planning on Obi Wan nearly killing Anakin and diminishing his potential. Anakin was on track to being far more powerful than Palpatine so it wouldn't make sense that Palpatine would make his new apprentice a major potential threat unless he knew Anakin would be completely under his control. This theory probably has a lot of problems but it makes more sense than the canon explanation.

You see I think palpatine all throughout the prequel and original trilogy was a clone. Possibly he had more than one clone. 
When he says that he died before, he may have been referring to his clone on the second Death Star. And hid clones may have died beforehand as well. 
This would explain yoda and obi wans force ghosts not knowing he was alive, because they never knew the real palpatine. In fact, palpatine has possibly lived many lives.
When he says he is all the Sith, he may be referring to the fact that almost every Sith before him is either a clone or a spawn of him.(besides Vader maul and dooku ofc) 
In fact his grand plan was ultimately to achieve unlimited power and immortality, which he ultimately did, he had the biggest fleet and the power to control multiple clones at once. 
I think palpatine is actually the apprentice to king ommin, who is now officially canon.
They used the same spine device and both lived a long time. 
Now he ultimately wanted to find a new host for his immense power, Luke succeeded and did not kill the emperor, as palpatine wanted. Rey failed and I think we will see palpatine instead of possessing Rey he will possess Rey’s offspring and lead not a new Sith order but an all new order in general.

Hear me out.


1. Yoda knew the Rule of Two. At Qui-Gon's funeral, Yoda quotes Darth Bane's law to Mace Windu, which is hardly common knowledge, even among the Jedi. That rule was established after the Sith were believed to have gone extinct, so it's not something the Jedi would have discovered without realizing the Sith were still around.


2. Yoda possesses intimate knowledge of the Dark Side of the Force. ""Fear leads to anger, anger leads to hate"" - speaking from experience, are you?


3. Yoda, to the best of my knowledge, never refers to himself as a Jedi. He frequently speaks about the Jedi as ""them"", and states that he trained Jedi for 800 years. But during their encounter on Geonosis, Dooku says ""I have become more powerful than any Jedi. Even you."" Yoda replies that Dooku has much to learn - maybe that Yoda is not that much of a Jedi?


4. Yoda is the one who leads the Clone Attack on Geonosis. In a way, it could be argued that Yoda starts the Clone Wars and thus brings about the fall of the Jedi Order.


5. Yoda was strictly against allowing Anakin into the Jedi Order - even though he was aware of the Prophecy. Perhaps he was afraid that the Chosen One would protect the Order from whatever his plan was?


6. Yoda possesses abilities some consider to be... unnatural, such as being able to deflect lightning with his bare hands. Similarly, his unusually long lifespan could be explained by the use of Dark Side knowledge, since we have little statistical data about the lifespans of his species.


7. Unlike most Jedi we see during Order 66, Yoda has no issue with executing his Clone commanders based on a hunch, before they have even attacked him. #YodaCutFirst


8. After the destruction of the Order, Yoda makes no efforts of any kind to restore it, rebuild it, or resist the Sith rulers of the galaxy. Instead, he goes into hiding on Dagobah, where - unlike Obi-Wan, who is protecting Luke - he has no mission or task.


9. Yoda does not emphasize Jedi values when training Luke Skywalker on Dagobah. He warns of the Dark Side being quicker, easier, more seductive, and that a Jedi must have deep commitment - but he never instills the Jedi Code, or indeed say that he himself was a Jedi. The training we see Luke performing is raw, physically challenging, and even sends him into a place of evil. 


10. When Luke returns to Dagobah, he says to Yoda that he can't die. Yoda replies that he's strong with the Force, but not that strong - implying that he is aware life-prolonging Dark Side knowledge, but nothing can achieve immortality.

94,1686934381.0,StarWarsTheories,"The Force as Nature Seeking Equilibrium - Hey, fellow Star Wars enthusiasts!

I was recently revisiting the Star Wars saga and wanted to share a thought. What if we consider the Force a natural phenomenon seeking balance, much like water finding its level in a landscape? Here's what I mean:

Consider that the Jedi and Sith codes could be seen as expressions of the Force's will. The Jedi code promotes order, while the Sith code encourages chaos and freedom through power. Now, look at the actions of the Jedi and Sith during the era of the Republic.

The Jedi, despite their code, were upholding order in a society that had corruption in its very fabric. An example is in Episode I: The Phantom Menace, where we see the Trade Federation's blockade and invasion of Naboo over a trade dispute, with the Galactic Senate unable to intervene effectively due to bureaucracy and gridlock. The Trade Federation's representatives even being part of the Senate shows the entanglement of corporate interests in the Republic's politics.

On the other side, the Sith, specifically Sidious and Vader, were not promoting chaos but instead creating a system, an order, that primarily benefits themselves. It was an evil order, but a form of order nevertheless.

In both cases, they weren't paying heed to the whole meaning of their respective codes or the will of the Force.

Now, what if the Force, being a primordial element of the Star Wars universe, reacted to this imbalance? Primordial elements aren't inherently good or evil; they just 'are'. They seek a ground state, and being too far from it can cause very destructive results in their path towards it. So, when both sides deviated from their paths, this created an imbalance that resulted in a substantial balancing action to bring things back into equilibrium.

Manifesting its will towards equilibrium via the chosen one, the broken Jedi and later the broken Sith were eliminated, and balance was achieved. Making way for Jedi and Sith on equal footing, adhering to their respective codes in a way that would create a balanced universe. It's not about good vs evil but balance, a stable state where light and dark exist, complementing each other.

What do you think? I'd love to hear your thoughts and interpretations!

(Note: This is just a theory and open to discussion. Star Wars is a vast universe with many interpretations, and this is just one possible way to look at it.)"

This would certainly create tension between them as Tarre would be hesitant to trust and train Sabine, while Sabine would be eager to learn all she can in order to reclaim her Mandalorian heritage.

This would have allowed Tarre to tell her his story and the history of the darksaber directly, which would have had a significant impact on her experience learning how to wield it. Tarre could have taught Sabine the Darksaber’s skills, as well as its importance, in a way that only he could. He could have shared the history of Mandalore and his family’s part in that history, as well as the Darksaber’s place in it.

The instruction Sabine received would have been incredibly focused on sharpening her skills on the darksaber itself, but with an emphasis on mental and spiritual preparation as well. The Darksaber teaches its wielders the importance of discipline and wisdom to ensure balanced and honorable use of the weapon. Sabine and Tarre could have had a more philosophical exchange of ideas, understanding the weight the darksaber had on their lives prior to Sabine’s possession of it.

Overall, the intensity and dynamic between Sabine and Tarre would have created a much different story with different implications than what we saw with Sabine and Kanan. As a result, Sabine would have been more prepared to lead her people and her journey to reclaim her heritage would have had a much deeper meaning."

What if more characters were like hondo The pirate

This is my frst fan fiction ever so I want to make it in a narrator point of view to Make it easier


In this time line  there’s an ancient religion coexisting with the force Both being galaxy wide religions which influence the Jedi and some Less evil sith  

The religion will be called the hut Faith someone think of a name for it 

It was spread Galaxy wide by the ancient huts and soon other species

Values of the hut Faith are

Steal from the rich give to the poor

Gambling to give to the poor

The rich give to the highest power to help the poor

Weapon ownership

Value the huts over yourself which eventually became some what lost as a hut Faith value over time
———-

As I said these values eventually affect the Jedi now to the story


Well for starters QUY gone Jin would never learn to trust in the force 100% which means no force ghost

The clones would never be invented as the galactic republic would give in to the separatist demands of giving the separatist worlds independence from the republic.

The republic and the separatist would actively trade  as the republic lost a lot of resources 

Palpation  would never become a Sith Lord as in this timeline  The Sith wars never ended  The galaxy was at constantly war 

But due to the chosen 1 theory no i’m not talking about Anakin 

The chosen one theory states overtime inequality and dictatorships start to crumble to the ground The Sith became a democracy ruled by the Darkside religion primarily

With the dark side and the light side now becoming different political parties in this galactic Civil War for complete galactic dominance

98,1686386135.0,StarWarsTheories,"Ben and Rey are manifestations of Anakin's life force - Hear me out.

&#x200B;

Has anyone ever thought it was a strange choice to only have Anakin appear as an ominous voice and not a force ghost in the ST? It's my belief that this was intentional. After Palpatine was resurrected into a clone abomination, Anakin's role as the chosen one was negated and the prophecy was left unfulfilled by the time of his death.

&#x200B;

So, the force threw Anakin's spirit back into the mortal realm as Ben Solo, who was conceived the very night Anakin died. The reason this makes sense is because Ben has always felt that his destiny was to ""complete"" what Vader started. But more than that, he's always felt that he's a monster and is unable to be saved. This is the same way Anakin felt as Darth Vader in ROTJ. My conclusion is Ben Solo is a pseudo-reincarnated Anakin. The reason Ben feels this way is because he feels Anakin's regret as Darth Vader despite not being able to recollect his memories.

&#x200B;

Palpatine took notice of Ben Solo's power and began manipulating him, using his odd obsession with Vader as a tool. So, the force also threw Rey into the mix as a sort of countermeasure to this, who possesses the same life force. However, Rey exhibits Anakin pre-Vader unlike Ben who seems to exhibit Anakin post-Vader. So, they were made two that are one, explaining their insanely powerful Dyad connection.

&#x200B;

More evidence to support this is when Palpatine returned, Kylo was DETERMINED to find and kill him, but why? If Kylo thinks Vader was the good guy, why would he think any different of the old Emperor? Theoretically they should be on the same side, but Kylo simply wasn't having it until he was offered the Sith fleet and to become what his grandfather could not. Palpatine then became a means to an end to Kylo. He did what he said, but Kylo clearly had no plans to become Sidious' apprentice.

&#x200B;

The only way that Palpatine would be destroyed was if Ben and Rey's dyad connection was completed and they began working together. This is when they would be closest to the force than ever, able to perform techniques any other force user wouldn't even be able to fathom.

&#x200B;

In this process, Ben is able to bring Rey back from the dead, fulfilling Anakin's ultimate personal goal with Padme. While Rey was able to destroy the Sith once and for all, fulfilling Anakin's objective goal. So in a sense, they are separate individuals that share the same life force and destiny. This is why Ben and Rey are the only ones to have seen/heard from Anakin's spirit after ROTJ.

&#x200B;

Also, Rey taking the Skywalker name makes more sense in a story perspective with this in mind."

105,1685558564.0,StarWarsTheories,"Dooku and Sifo Dyas were once lovers - Cavan Scott's ""Dooku: Jedi Lost"" is rife with subtext that there was more to the relationship between Dooku and Sifo Dyas than what we saw on the surface. 

Could it just be that they were so close they considered themselves as brothers? Sure, I suppose...but if that were the case, why not just say that? Star Wars media has never shied away from characters referring to each other as brothers. To me, they were tender with one another in a way that does not suggest 'brothers.'

At multiple points, young love is hinted at through internal monologue and dialogue between the pair.  And their pet names for one another.

At one point, young Dooku privately laments that Sifo is ""the only one who understands."" Understands what? Dooku was not yet struggling with the Dark Side at this point in time. His repressed anger at having been abandoned was not yet understood. And Dooku did not share Sifo's haunting visions (which were not yet that bad, I believe)...so...what? What do they both understand? I think it is that they both experienced feelings of attachment for one another. Romantic attachment was forbidden, so two Jedi younglings in close proximity to one another sharing those kinds of feelings must have been a special kind of agony. 

I believe their exploration of the Bogan Collection together was kind of metaphorical. They were both doing things together they knew they shouldn't. Lene Kostana discovered them but did not judge them...in fact supported them both & encouraged their interests, a fact which at first repulsed the repressed young Dooku but soon earned his deep devotion. (Was this a possible hint that Lene herself was gay? Or once in love with another Jedi?)

Much later, Rael Aveross (Dooku's former padawan) meets with Dooku and wonders why he is so reluctant to meet with Lene and Sifo, who have returned to Coruscant from a long time in space. Rael says, ""I know how much he means to you."" Why does Rael put it that way, when Dooku appears to be ducking them both? That Dooku loves both Lene and Sifo is obvious at any point in the text. So why does he have a hard time seeing them and why does Rael specify that Dooku's unwillingness is more due to Sifo? Because the love he has for Sifo is the kind of love he cannot act on. Seeing him hurts Dooku in a way heartache for a lover one cannot be with does. I think it also hurts him deeply to see Sifo falling more into the madness caused by the visions...and, sure, that could just be because they were best friends...but it seems like more to me. 

Additionally, Rael (who definitely canonically FUCKS) is at one point commenting on how hot he thinks Lene is and Dooku is grossed out. Perhaps it's just because he views her as an older sister or an aunt figure or something. But the way in which Dooku blows Rael's comment off to me suggests something more. I think Dooku is at the very least ace if not gay. 

The thing that surprises me even in spite of my theory is that Dooku never tries to sire (or else create the illusion of having sired) an heir to the sovereignty of Serenno. He was getting up there in years. Consolidating and keeping power on his homeworld seemed of utmost importance to him. Even if he literally did not care what happened after he died, the appearance of having an heir...a dynasty...while alive would have been beneficial for that. I guess the war just kept him too occupied to think about it much. 

ALSO HE WAS SO HEARTBROKEN HE COULD NEVER EVEN CONSIDER IT.

Thank you. 

P.S.: BTW, I once asked Scott about this and all he had to say on it was that any interpretation was valid. The tweet has since been deleted so I don't know what to make of that. I think they were definitely playing it safe leaving it as subtext. But it's also possible it was all in my head. I just don't think so.

P.P.S.: It's been a long time since I saw the later-seasons TCW episode dealing with Dooku & Dyas, but I remember it not really meshing too well with this theory. Perhaps years of dark side corruption just made Dooku callous about his old ""friend,"" but there has always been a LOT about this little story thread that never added up. I feel like creatives know how shaky the ground is surrounding the creation of the clone army and they know we don't want to look at it too hard lest the whole thing fall apart.

P.P.P.S.: I will not be entertaining ship names containing poop jokes at this time. You are free to make them, but I will probably only laugh internally. ;)"

109,1684331138.0,StarWarsTheories,"Jabba the Hutt is Kylo Ren’s Father (or was at some point intended to be) - One of the most common criticisms of the sequel trilogy is how most of the backstory and set-up are left unexplained. But I keep coming back to one theory that would tie it all together and have it make near-perfect sense.

Jabba the Hutt is Kylo Ren’s father.

The explanation is simple. While Jabba’s prisoner on Tatooine, Leia and Jabba knew each other in the biblical sense and conceived a child. Perhaps it was a one-night fling, or the will of the Force, or something else that brought them together. (We also don’t know how Hutts reproduce, so it is possible him licking her was enough)

Fast forward 20 or so years, and our heroes learn the truth about Ben “Solo”. Their reaction to this new information accounts for much of the sequel trilogy’s set-up.

- Why Luke attempted to murder his nephew and then went into exile
- Why Han left Leia to go back to smuggling 
- Why Ben Solo joined the Dark Side and his strained relationship with his parents in the films
- Who is Snoke (probably the one to inform Ben about his true parentage)
- The weird anti-obsession with Rey’s parentage that the sequel trilogy has. Thematically, it now fits, as does Kylo’s fascination with Rey.

Given the disjointed production of the sequel trilogy, it is fair to ask if this was JJ (or someone else’s) original intent, and who changed it along the way. I will not speculate on that here, but I think the evidence is mostly self-explanatory. Am I missing anything?"

They could possibly put him into canon now because they could use the excuse “force sensitive clones can’t have the full potential of the original donor.” Boom, easy nerf. Where he would come into canon would be in the new Ashoka show. It would be so cool to see both Anakins apprentices fight it out or even just cross paths.

116,1683241125.0,StarWarsTheories,"Darksaber owners - I just finished mandlorian season 3 and was searching on a dark saber info. And I found that many people really miss one part. Manly as I see people agree that Sabine was the rightful owner of it. But actually Sidious defeated Maul when he had it. And that’s where it becomes tricky. Does owner need to have darksaber with him while being defeated for the winner to became rightful owner? 

Because if thought, Mace was owned it for a minute since he disarmed Palpatine and than in comes to a question who defeated Mace in the first place. So if ownership over the darksaber doesn’t relay on actually having it and Sidious counts as winner of mace, darksaber goes to Luke as son of Anakin who killed Sidious in ROTJ, but if Vader counts as a Mace killer, that’s mean saber belongs to a first person who did defeat Vader (as far as I know there were a few people who did it before RTOJ I just don’t know who was first and who wan‘t defeated by Vader back)

And in its more confusing if defeating owner who doesn’t carry the darksaber, than Palpatine was the last owner since he defeated Maul but didn’t use the saber

117,1682723204.0,StarWarsTheories,"Ahsoka Series/Heir to the Empire Movie Theory - 
I have a crazy theory but follow me.

The Empire, specifically Grand Admiral Thrawn, are going to clone Maul for the Ahsoka series/Heir to the Empire movie. Thrawn would probably want to clone Maul and use him as a weapon for the Empire as a counter to any Jedi/Force wielders since they can’t really counter them. Maul would be a good deterrent as he could kill any Jedi/Force Wielder and protect high ranking Imperials, basically being the Empire version of a “New Darth Vader” in the New Republic era. Thrawn would use Maul as a personal body guard since Ruhk died in Star Wars Rebels and he would be a good replacement.

They would be able to clone Maul as Palpatine had Maul captured on Stygeon  during the Clone Wars, in the Son of Dathomir comic, so it’s very likely he would have some of Maul’s DNA. With Palpatine dead it’s possible the Empire would have found or been given his DNA. And recently we saw that Moff Gideon was making force sensitive clones, in The Mandalorian Season 3, so it’s possible to make one. 

Since they’re already changing aspects of  Heir to the Empire, Maul could fit into that story easily. Also, at the end of the Heir to the Empire story Maul could escape and go find Talon and then we could do some of the stuff George Lucas’s originally planned for his sequel trilogy."
118,1682519904.0,StarWarsTheories,"Theory - Ned-B from Obi-Wan is Tech from the Bad Batch - Hi all,

Theory here linking the Bad Batch to Obi-Wan.

At the end of the Bad Batch, we see Tech fall to his ""death"" - however as the old adage goes, no body means no death.

In the Obi-Wan show, we see that there is a large emphasis placed on the death of droid Ned-B, to whom Tala seems to have an affection to him that suggests their relationship is deeper than that of a human droid relationship. The fact she decides so quickly sacrifice herself after she realizes Ned-B is no more emphasizes this for me

My theory is that Dr. Hemlock recover's Tech's body and places his brain in a droid clone hybrid of some description that the Bad Batch will fight in season 3. I think this could be interesting, because during Season 1 and 2 Crosshair has been the internal antagonist, but maybe this will switch in Season 3. I also feel it would be very in the nature of Hemlock to perform such a cruel experiment, maybe building on what the Seperatists did to Echo but going a step further and turning him into a killing machine. Perhaps it will be Echo that realises that the droid they are fighting has a clone inside - i.e. The TechDroid knowing their tactics etc.

In my theory the Bad Batch will eventually save him, but he will only be an echo of his former self existing in a loading droid, that we come to know as Ned-B in the Obi-Wan show. and all the Bad Batch will ultimately perish except for Tech, living on in Ned-B.

It's also hard to tell comparing faces between live action and animation, but I wonder does the shell of Tech's personality associate Tala with Phee, and their relationship blossoms from there.

Thoughts?"

“Two there should be; one to embody the power, the other to crave it. A Master, and an Apprentice. Do you understand?”

“Yes, Master.”

“One day you shall take my rightful place as Master, and yet you shall find another apprentice who will succeed you also. The Sith bloodline will grow stronger with each generation, until we are ready to announce our return to the galaxy. Do you understand this also?”

“Yes, Master.”

“Eventually we shall have our revenge, and together we shall destroy the Jedi once and for all.”

“I will not fail you, my Master.”

“Rise, my apprentice,” Darth Bane said triumphantly.

📷

“This is the culmination of centuries of brilliant planning, Lord Sidious,” Plagueis said, holding up a bottle of wine as he took a seat in front of his apprentice, “Tomorrow we shall have you elected Chancellor, and tomorrow we shall sound the death knell of the Republic.”

""A toast to our success, then,"" Sidious replied airily, ""The Sith will return to power at last, and the Jedi won’t even see it coming.”

They smiled at each other, and clinked their glasses.

📷

As the night wore on, Plagueis drained glass after glass of wine until his eyelids felt droopy.

Sidious, however, was still as energetic as ever. He paced around the room anxiously, reciting his speech that he would deliver to the Senate tomorrow, gesticulating and mumbling madly.

“Lord Sidious,” Plagueis began wearily, “I think you should go home-”

“Nonsense,” Sidious retorted, “I haven’t finished my speech yet. Just let me do it one more time, Master.”

Plagueis tried again. “Uh, I think you really should go back and catch a few hours of shut-eye. We have a big day tomorrow-”

“Just one more time, Master.”

*Whatever*. Plagueis’s vision was already beginning to blur, and he involuntarily tipped the glass over. Wine spilled onto the table. He finally blacked out and fell into a deep, deep slumber.

At that very precise moment, Sidious stopped pacing. Gazing at his master for a long moment, Sidious quietly reached for his cloak and put it on, slowly conjuring the Dark Side of the Force within him. His eyes flickered from blue to yellow, and he could feel his own anger build within him until it was a powerful storm ready to be unleashed.

*Old fool.* He spat inwardly, and raised his palm over Plagueis’s prone form-

Plagueis’s eyes snapped open just as Sidious unleashed a powerful burst of Force Lightning, but he reacted quickly enough to draw his own blade and deflected the attack. Sidious staggered back, startled.

“And so the time comes,” Plagueis said slowly, “The apprentice betrays the master.”

“Isn’t that what the Rule of Two is about?” Sidious said slyly as he let his lightsaber slide into his palm. “The apprentice eventually *becomes* the master.”

To his surprise, Plagueis let out a guffaw. “My disciple,” he sneered disdainfully, “You really don’t understand any of this, do you? The Rule of Two was never really about an apprentice and a master. It was about the master. *Only.*”

“What the hell are you talking about?” Sidious snapped. He activated his crimson blade, pointing it directly at Plagueis’s chest. “Don’t lecture me, old-timer-”

“Do you really think the Sith would be willingly to share power with someone else? That the master would choose an apprentice who would eventually kill him and succeed his throne? The Rule of Two,” Plagueis smirked, “Was all about one person. The ultimate master. The one and only Sith Lord. The Sith’ari himself. *Darth Bane*.”

He spread his arms triumphantly. “Do you still not understand, my young apprentice? I *am* Darth Bane.”

“Wha-what the fuck?” Sidious spluttered, gazing at the bottle of wine on the table. He rubbed his eyes. *This was wine, right?*

“And not just that, Lord Sidious,” Plagueis continued, “I have been every Sith Lord that came after him. Darth Zannah. Darth Cognus. Darth Millennial. Darth Vectivus. Darth Guile. Darth Gravid. Darth Gean. Darth Ramage. Darth Tenebrous. And *finally, Darth Plagueis.”*

He smiled, his eyes boring into his apprentice.

“I mastered the art of **Essence Transfer** long ago. It is an arcane ability in the Force, one I have refined after decades of practice. Since then I have sought apprentice after apprentice, each stronger than the last. I have passed through dozens of host bodies, and my power has expanded a thousand-fold. And you, Lord Sidious, you are the most powerful Force vessel I have ever encountered. A literal anomaly in the Dark Side. For years I have patiently trained you, groomed you to be my next host. And now……you are ripe for my taking.”

And it was at that precise moment when Sidious realized that he had been deceived for many, many years.

His thoughts drifted back to his own childhood, when he first discovered the existence of the Sith by reading about them; when he met Darth Plagueis for the first time and murdered his entire family under his orders; when he trained under his master as a Sith apprentice, slowly refining and expanding his own power; when he and his master toppled the balance of the Force and clouded the minds of the Jedi.

Everything he had done, in order to secure his place as a Sith. To control and master the Dark Side of the Force. To bring back the glorious old days of the Sith Empire and rule over the galaxy.

Everything - and in the end, for *nothing*.

He was just a tool to be used, abused and discarded when no longer needed.

A primal anger surged in him like never before, the Dark Side of the Force literally erupting within him and flowing through his veins, and he guided his crimson blade towards his master’s chest, determined to secure his own future, his own *survival*\-

But instead of counterattacking, Plagueis simply stood there - and allowed Sidious thrust the blade into him. Smoky tendrils of the Dark Side began to emanate from the wound, and they flowed right into Sidious’s body.

“At last, the ritual is complete,” he smiled as Sidious staggered back in horror, desperately trying to shake off the dark tendrils that were invading his very being. “Goodbye, my apprentice, you have served me very, very well.”

Chancellor Palpatine lowered his gaze to the little boy standing in front of him.

He smiled.

“We will watch your career with great interest,” he said kindly as he clapped his hand on Anakin Skywalker’s shoulder.

📷

“Did you ever hear the tragedy of Darth Plagueis the wise?”

“No.” Anakin gazed at the Chancellor curiously.

“I thought not. It's not a story the Jedi would tell you. It's a Sith legend.”

“Darth Plagueis was a Dark Lord of the Sith, so powerful and so wise he could use the Force to influence the midi-chlorians to create…..life.”

“He had such a knowledge of the dark side, he could even keep the ones he cared about from dying.”

“He could actually save people from death?” Anakin asked, clearly stunned by the revelation.

“The dark side of the Force is a pathway to many abilities some consider to be unnatural.”

“What happened to him?” Anakin asked.

“He became so powerful, the only thing he was afraid of was losing his power, which eventually, of course, he did. Unfortunately, he taught his apprentice everything he knew, then his apprentice killed him in his sleep.”

He sneered inwardly. “Ironic. He could save others from death……but not himself.”

“Is it possible to learn this power?” Anakin asked urgently.

The Chancellor slowly turned his head towards him.

And Darth Plagueis said,

“*Not from a Jedi*.”

📷

“Henceforth, you shall be known as……Darth Vader.”

“Thank you, my Master.” Anakin said gratefully.

Palpatine smiled. Finally, he had found **the** perfect new vessel. The Jedi Chosen One, the Champion of the Light, a being of pure Force, the most powerful Force-sensitive ever born into existence……

This one would serve him well.

📷

Palpatine sighed inwardly as he saw Anakin’s mangled body on the lava banks. He cursed himself inwardly - he had sent that idiot to Mustafar to hone his newfound Dark Side powers, and yet he had returned to him as a half-dead Sith corpse.

The Sith Emperor was sorely tempted to just abandon him there, but he decided that he was still somewhat useful, after all. He needed an attack dog to do the dirty work for him - hunting down the remaining Jedi, destroying pockets of Separatist resistance in the galaxy, exploring Sith worlds and retrieving artifacts for him, and so on.

So he decided to scoop up the barely-alive Vader and carried him back to Coruscant. He ordered his guards to prepare the most painful, inconvenient, heavy, and shitty life-support suit they could find, as punishment for his apprentice’s incompetency.

📷

“There is a great disturbance in the Force.” Palpatine said emotionlessly.

“I have felt it.” Vader replied, equally emotionlessly.

“We have a new enemy, the young Rebel who destroyed the Death Star. I have no doubt this boy is the offspring of Anakin Skywalker.”

Vader looked up in shock. “How is that possible?”

“Search your feelings, Lord Vader. You will know it to be true. He could destroy us.”

“He’s just a boy. Obi-Wan can no longer help him.”

“The Force is strong with him. The son of Skywalker must not become a Jedi.”

“If he could be turned, he will become a powerful ally.”

“Yes. He would be a great asset. Can it be done?” Palpatine asked, although he already knew the answer. He did have a flair for theatrics, after all.

“He will join us or die, my Master.” Vader bowed.

As he cut the holographic transmission, Palpatine cackled inwardly to himself. He had not expected that Vader’s offspring had survived; but once he realized what was going on, he could barely contain his excitement.

*The son of the former Chosen One. Though not quite as powerful as the father, but more than enough to serve my purposes.*

📷

“Good! Your hate has made you powerful. Now, fulfill your destiny and take your father’s place at my side.” Palpatine crooned.

Honestly, he hated his current vessel already. When he had transferred his own essence into Palpatine’s body and adopted his identity, he soon realized that this body was too old for his purposes. His bones and muscles rapidly grew weaker day by day, ravaged not only by aged but also by the Dark Side as well.

He desperately needed a new vessel to inhabit.

And that’s why his anger flared up when Luke cast aside the lightsaber and defiantly declared himself as a Jedi.

“Never. I'*ll never turn* to the Dark Side. You've failed, your highness. I am a Jedi, like my father before me.”

Palpatine seethed. Such a beautiful new vessel - wasted yet again.

*Very well.*

He raised his hands and brilliant bursts of Force Lightning poured forth from his fingers, striking the foolish young Jedi and sending him screaming and writhing on the floor. He tried to prolong the Jedi’s suffering, pouring wave after wave of hatred and pain on him, but then he felt a blinding presence suddenly materialize behind him that made him take a step back.

It was as bright as a thousand burning suns, a supernova in the Force, a potent nexus of the Light Side - never throughout his thousand-year career as an Sith Lord had Palpatine encountered such power before.

He turned, and realized belatedly that it was Lord Vader - no, it was **Anakin Skywalker**.

The Chosen One.

A split second of shock - and Palpatine turned the full power of his Force Lightning on Anakin, out of anger and utter frustration - but when Anakin shook off his powers as if they were nothing, when Anakin lifted him up almost effortlessly and cast Palpatine screaming all the way down a reactor shaft-

Palpatine realized he had failed once again. His own plan utterly backfired on him.

What’s more, he could sense the Force balancing itself again - the Jedi had been destroyed, and now the Sith were destroyed too. Light and Dark finally achieving equilibrium. The ancient prophecy fulfilled at last.

But he knows that the balance won’t last for long. Because Palpatine had a plan. He always had a plan. After all, he had planned the Jedi’s demise for thousands of years- an obstacle like this won’t stop him from his goal of achieving unlimited power.

The game was not over yet.

In a split second, he willed his own spirit out of his body, and sent it across the vast, empty void of space. He sent it to a planet far, far away.

**Exegol.**

📷

Palpatine smiled weakly as he watched his servants set down the coffin in front of him.

Technically it wasn’t a coffin - it was a pod designed on Kamino that was meant to cryogenically preserve a corpse.

The body that lay inside was of utmost importance to Palpatine.

He gazed at it - or rather, himself.

The lifeless face of Darth Plagueis stared back at him. He had long abandoned this vessel, this identity ever since he transferred his spirit into Palpatine, but he still made orders to preserve his former body should the need arise for him to use it again.

“Clone it,” he said to his followers, members of the ancient Sith cult known as the Sith Eternal, “I will give you further directions once its done.”

“Yes, my Lord,” they bowed, and retreated away into the shadows.

📷

The Plagueis clones were soon ready to be deployed.

Honestly it was quite difficult to clone a Force-user; the Sith Eternal had cloned hundreds of copies, and yet only three of them survived. And even Palpatine had to admit - those clones were ugly as hell.

But that didn’t matter. The clones would be useful to him. Their minds were annihilated through the use of Sith Alchemy; turned into willing, mindless slaves that only did what their master directed them to do.

Palpatine gave them a new name - Snoke.

The first one was quickly transported out of Exegol, to secretly engineer the fall of the New Republic and the rise of the First Order; the other two would be kept in stasis on Exegol for further use if necessary. Palpatine realized that he still had to remain in the shadows for the time being; so he used Snoke as a proxy to control the First Order and to rebuild his fallen empire once again.

Palpatine rubbed his hands together and cackled as he started doing what he did best - outsmarting and dethroning his political enemies through the use of cunning and manipulation. He watched in satisfaction as the old Imperial warlords and generals were removed from power, replaced by Palpatine’s own people.

It was around this time that Palpatine noticed someone else.

Ben Solo.

He was the sole offpsring of Leia Organa - who was in truth, a Skywalker and thus inherited Anakin’s powerful bloodline - and the smuggler Han Solo. Ben was currently a Jedi-in-training under Luke Skywalker, but Palpatine could easily sense his resentment towards his uncle and the Jedi Order in general. Reaching across the galaxy, he could feel the darkness brooding within him - he was so much like Lord Vader, after all - and he also had vast potential in the Force, which meant……

Yes, he will be a fitting vessel. He will, indeed. He couldn’t let his opportunity be wasted again.

And so Palpatine started feeding Ben’s inner darkness, giving him directions and conjuring visions; one he was prepared, he also let Ben Solo meet up with Snoke for the very first time. Snoke played the role of the kindly grandfather willing to listen to Ben letting out his inner frustration……and in the process, slowly bring out the worst in him.

Predictably, Ben Solo snapped after a few years of constant brainwashing. For such an intelligent boy, Ben was surprising gullible - and Palpatine laughed in glee as Ben led his Knights of Ren and marched up the steps of the Jedi Academy. It reminded him of that night on Coruscant, decades ago, when Anakin Skywalker turned on his own brethren and slaughtered them in the Jedi Temple.

*Those were good times*, he thought fondly.

Once that was done, Ben pledged himself to Snoke as his new apprentice. He now served the First Order, and of course Palpatine himself.

Eventually the boy will try to betray Snoke, and once he’s done, he will be ready.

For Palpatine to use at his leisure.

📷

Just when Palpatine was busy grooming Ben Solo, who was now rechristened as Kylo Ren, something alarming came to Palpatine’s attention- the reemergence of a certain girl he had thought dead long ago.

Rey.

The Sith Lord had been trying to track down the girl for years, to no avail. His Sith assassins had murdered her father and mother, but they couldn’t locate the daughter despite their best efforts. For all he cared, they may have dumped her on some random backwater planet in the Unknown Regions, and he couldn’t bother wasting all his resources on trying to locate a single person.

So he redirected his efforts on other projects, such as the construction of the Sith fleet under Exegol’s surface. He needed a powerful fleet to subjugate the galaxy - and to do this, he incorporated elements of the Death Star and Starkiller Base, turning the Sith fleet into one massive planet-killing superweapon.

But after Starkiller Base’s destruction, the girl had rather foolishly shown herself to the galaxy - and to Palpatine.

*Good, good*, Palpatine thought. The girl’s strength in the Force was unbelievable, almost, almost enough to match the former Chosen One himself. At this point, Ren was no longer important - he had become a mere pawn, another Vader for Palpatine to manipulate and use until he became useless.

Rey, on the other hand - well, she was indispensable. Palpatine desperately wanted this vessel.

“Long have I waited, for my grandchild to come home! I never wanted you dead. I wanted you here……Empress Palpatine.”

But Rey was stubborn as hell. She kept rejecting the Dark Side, and this angered Palpatine.

“Strike me down, and I will possess you.”

But Rey was stubborn as hell. She didn’t strike him down, and this angered Palpatine even more.

What’s worse, the next time he saw her, she even brought alone her new friend - a reformed Ben Solo, now a Jedi and no longer affiliated with the Dark.

Once again, his plan backfired completely. Not only had he wasted another vessel - he had also wasted another apprentice.

Palpatine was so angry he couldn’t even speak. Much like what he had done to Luke years ago, he started torturing the two Jedi with the Force. He didn’t care about the vessel anymore, he just wanted to vent his anger. He’ll find another one in time.

But his anger soon turned into delight when he accidentally used his Force Drain on them.

He realized something he was supposed to realize earlier - Rey and Ben were a dyad in the Force!

Back when he was still a Sith apprentice under Skere Kaan’s Sith Order, the Brotherhood of Darkness, he had read about the “Force dyad” - a mysterious anomaly in the Force unseen for generations, a power like life itself. The last dyad to be created was apparently during the era of the Old Republic, between a Sith Lord named Darth Revan and his wife Bastila Shan.

After the Brotherhood’s destruction on Ruusan, he had escaped and started seeking another apprentice; partly because he wanted a new vessel for him to inhabit, and partly because he wanted to recreate this dyad with them. With a dyad, he probably wouldn’t even need to find a new vessel anymore. That power alone was enough to sustain him for centuries, millennia even.

He laughed in delight, and began to drain them both.

📷

“You are nothing! A scavenger girl is no match for the power in me! I. Am. All. The. Sith!” Palpatine snarled.

As he unleashed the full power of his Force Lightning on the girl, he remembered that night in the 500 Republica, when he was about to transfer his essence into his apprentice,

“*Do you not understand? I am Darth Bane. And not just that; I have been every Sith Lord that came after him. Darth Zannah. Darth Cognus. Darth Millennial. Darth Vectivus. Darth Guile. Darth Gravid. Darth Gean. Darth Ramage. Darth Tenebrous. And finally, Darth Plagueis.”*

He was all the Sith indeed. He was the personification of the Rule of Two, the Sith’ari, the most powerful Sith Lord in all of existence, the Dark Side of the Force incarnate. His power had passed through dozens of Sith for centuries, having grown to unimaginable heights, and now having absorbed the dyad as well-

Palpatine felt like a *god.*

He was truly unbeatable, and he would remain so for generations to come.

But after a few moments, he began to realize that somehow this scavenger girl was resisting his power. No matter how much Force Lightning he had poured forth from his fingers, the girl was somehow finding a way to absorb the power - disturbingly, this reminded him of what Anakin had done years ago on the Second Death Star.

Then Anakin murdered him by throwing him down a reactor shaft. No, no, no, he won’t let his happen again - he won’t let the girl kill him………

Frustrated, he redoubled his attack-

Until he heard the girl scream one final defiant declaration,

“I,” she thundered, “am ***all the Jedi***!”

Another lightsaber appeared in her hand, and she crossed them in front of her chest.

The Force Lightning blasted back at its source, and Palpatine screamed as it violently ripped through his Force defenses and set every inch of his body aflame. *Impossible! He was supposed to be the most powerful Sith in existence, and yet here he was, losing to a girl with barely any training in the Force? Why-*

In one desperate attempt, he reached out with the Force to shatter the girl’s mind - and stopped in his tracks as he realized in utter shock what was happening.

There were hundreds - no, thousands - of them. Thousands of Jedi spirits, gathering within Rey, giving her the power she needed to defeat Palpatine. He could see his ancient enemies, like Valenthyne Farfalla, whom he had fought against when he was still known as Darth Bane; and more recent adversaries, like Yoda, Windu, Obi-Wan, Luke Skywalker, and of course-

Anakin Skywalker.

The Chosen One of the Force. The eternal enemy of the Sith. The final downfall of the Dark Side.

Palpatine gave one final scream as his body exploded under the combined might of the Jedi Order and shattered into a million pieces, bringing down his Dark Throne as well as the thousands of Sith Eternal cultists that had surrounded the stadium. As if reacting instantly, the Force shifted again, the Light Side gaining ground against the Dark until balance was finally achieved.

Palpatine was desperate.

He could feel his spirit slowly drifting apart in the maddening void of the Force, with nothing to cling on to, and he tried to search for any vessel to inhabit, or perhaps a physical object to anchor himself to the real world.

He found nothing. He was truly lost.

As his consciousness was slowly torn apart by the void, his thoughts drifted back into the past - when he had joined Skere Kaan’s Brotherhood of Darkness, when he destroyed the Brotherhood and built his own Sith Order, when he had transferred his spirit across dozens of Sith apprentices under the guise of the Rule of Two, when he destroyed the Jedi and forged an empire, when he resurrected himself after his death at the hands of Anakin Skywalker, and his last stand on Exegol against the Jedi and the Resistance.

Thousands of years of planning - and he had failed. His life’s work was entirely in vain. He had raised the Sith Order to the pinnacle of glory, only to let it be destroyed once and for all, never to rise up again.

And now he had no choice but to embrace the one thing he feared most - death.

If Palpatine still had a mouth, he wished he could scream."
121,1682182839.0,StarWarsTheories,"Ashoka Theory - Ok so hear me out. This is just a personal theory I came up with, but I put spoiler just in case it ends up being true.

So we don’t see Ezra in the trailer except for a small bit on hologram and I’ve been wondering where he is in between Star Wars rebels, and the Asoka timeline. We know that in rebels, he saves Asoka by using the world between worlds to pull her out of her timeline. But I think I’ve found the solution. I feel like we will not see Ezra throughout the entirety of the Asoka series because at the end, she will probably use the world between worlds to pull him out of his timeline in a complete reversal. We see her in the trailer in the world between worlds fighting Baylon. What if at the end of the fight, she uses the world between worlds to pull Ezra out of his timeline and into the future? Presumably directly after the fight with Thrawn. It would explain why he is not present in between the series, as he technically was pulled to the future? It would also allow Thrawn the freedom to slowly pull the Empire back together, like we’ve been seeing in both the Mandalorian timeline, and the upcoming Asoka series and become the heir to the Empire. Perhaps by doing this, they are setting Ezra up as a possible ally of Rey later on in the movies? 

Just a theory, but let me know your thoughts!"

123,1682013360.0,StarWarsTheories,"Ezra will return as a villain for Ashoka - This will probably rub a few people the wrong way but I believe Ezra fell to the dark side after vanishing with Thrawn. I believe Thrawn has copied the Empire to a T but has made his own improvements to it. I think he created his own Inquisitors and expanded on their function and purpose. Likely these inquisitors will be more dangerous. My thinking is that Ezra was tortured by Thrawn and bent to his will but he's not just a regular Inquisitor. I think Ezra either serves as Thrawn's own Vader or as the Grand Inquisitor maybe both.

I think one of two things will happen an Ashoka will get Ezra away from Thrawn and deprogram him or Ezra and his inquisitors will take over Thrawn's empire and Ashoka will end up seeing him go down a path similar to Anakin. I prefer the later as I feel her need to not train others and avoid calling herself a jedi should come back to bite her. She's clearly running away from her problems, and I think it'd be intersting if in trying to avoid creating another Vader her actions instead guaranteed history repeating.

I think some Inquisitors are in the galaxy acting as Thrawn's emissaries and by the end of Season 1 Ezra will show up as the Grand Inquisitor after being ordered to deal with her and Season 2 of Ashoka will be about saving and redeeming Ezra. Likely Ezra will mirror Vader and cause Ashoka even more emotional stress for her to overcome."
124,1681966122.0,StarWarsTheories,"Yoda, Yaddle, and Grogu’s species origin theory - Might be a wild theory, but I wonder if the “Yoda species” are not actually from a “system”, but an embodiment of the Force itself. Yoda, Yaddle, and Grogu were likely born Force-sensitive and extremely powerful. Given the idea that the Force surrounds the universe and creates life naturally, maybe their species are a creation of the Force itself.

They have the longest lifespan of any humanoid species known in SW, they hone Force abilities easily at a young age, there are only 3 known canonically (sorry Vandar), and no droid or archive has ANY knowledge about their species. 

Now, IF the Anakin theory is true about Darth Plagueis being his creator manipulating Midi-chlorians to create life, this can be a contrast between embodiment of the Force (Y,Y, an G) VS manifestation using the Force (Anakin)."

126,1681942318.0,StarWarsTheories,"Theory - Young Jedi Adventures Antagonist Taborr Is Nihil - The connection between the character Taborr from the fifth episode and his ""band of pirates"" (from episode synopsis ""When Taborr and his band of pirates pillage the Kublop Springs marketplace, Kai, Lys, and Nubs spring into action to stop them"") to the pirate/marauder organization the Nihil is clear. Whether this was merely inspiration or relates to the plot/character remains, of course, to be seen. The physical appearance of Taborr is especially similar to that of Marchion Ro, the Eye Of The Nihil. Similar color scheme, helmet, boots, ragged cape, and utility belt. However, those costume details aren't exactly unique. The possibility of Taborr being the son of Marchion Ro is apparent, and the lack of skin shown in the promotional materials also means the possibility is still open (blue skin of the Evereni.)

Further evidence of the connection between Taborr and his pirates and the Nihil is that the date of the show takes place ""200 years before 'The Phantom Menace' during the High Republic Era"" (according to the 4.11.23 SW Celeb Wrap Up Press Blast) - which would correspond to 232 BBY (Before the Battle of Yavin)/(Year 3045/Lothal Calendar, 213 BFE/Imperial calendar, and year 7745/CRC calendar) - thus putting it in line with the Great Hyperspace Disaster, and the aftermath. As the disaster was caused by the Nihil, alongside the Blythe family raid, the Trymant IV attack, and GR Starship Steady Wing bombing + indirect release of the Drengir, the likelihood of the pirates' affiliation with the Nihil is likely.

To conclude, it is plausible that Taborr is the son of Marchion Ro, or at least is a member of the Nihil, alongside a small (described as a ""band"") Strike group (unlikely that it's a Cloud, but possible) and that the Nihil, and Taborr, will either be recurring antagonists in season 2 or that one of the many events in 232 BBY, specifically the GHD and the release of the Drengir, will be the subject of future episodes.

However, there is no concrete evidence to support the theory that Dedra Meero and Phasma are the same person.

Additionally, the timeline of the Star Wars movies and TV shows is not clear, so it is possible that Dedra Meero and Phasma could exist at the same time.

132,1681511181.0,StarWarsTheories,"Mando Season 3 Finale: Holistic Theory of Misdirection - * **Primary Theory**: Misdirection plays a key role in the season, affecting Bo-Katan's storyline ***(SHE DIES)***, the identity of ""The Spies,"" and the possible outcome of Din Djarin becoming Mandalore and Grogu taming the Mythosaur.
* **IG-11 Misdirection**: In the early episodes of the season, Disney seemed to be bringing IG-11 back from the dead, leading to fan frustration over the repeated use of character resurrections in the Star Wars franchise. However, this turned out to be a clever ruse, as IG-11 was actually being transformed into Grogu's Mech suit, a twist that was successfully hidden by the misdirection.
* **Bo-Katan's Storyline**:
   * Bo-Katan's past: Her account of losing the Darksaber and her emotional reaction after discussing the Great Purge raise suspicions about her true involvement in those events.
   * Bo-Katan's potential death: A surprising twist could involve her sacrificing herself because of her guilt, allowing Din to acquire the Darksaber and become Mandalore.
   * This would also work well to reinforce the arc of the entirety of the Mandalorian people. Bo in a way symbolizes the Mandalorian's past. Din, in contrast, is the future of the Mandalorians and a symbolic clean slate for their people. I mean, look at his armor. Its literally a clean slate....
   * This would be a good payoff for Bo, in contrast to just simply giving her a shot at leadership again. That is a one dimensional idea and honestly is not interesting character development.
   * Din has sort of been put in this box of staying this ""wandering traveler"" per lots of Pro Bo theories, and I don't think that is a particular interesting Arc.
   * In contrast, Din's growth from a wandering bounty hunter, to a father, to a leader would be far more interesting.
   * Din can weave together all of the Mandoverse shows together without Bo. **I think during the episode, he will find a way to send out a distress signal to the galaxy. This will grow his legend far across the galaxy, and make it plausible he would connect with the other characters.**
* **The Identity of The Spies**: The preoccupation with determining their identity could be another example of misdirection.
   * Skinny Pete and his clan on Mandalore are The Spies, as they led the characters directly into the base. Its foolish to think they have far reaching implications on the rest of the show's story..... Its the title of one episode, dont read into it too much...
   * Many have also brought up the idea that the title might be a reference to the bible.
* **Controversy Misdirection**: The controversy over the possibility of Bo-Katan becoming ""the Mandalorian"" referenced in the show's title could be a misdirection, as we've seen with IG-11.
   * **What if the true twist is that Bo-Katan will meet her end this season?** I think it's unlikely that the writers would take Din away from his own show, so it's possible that this is all a clever misdirection.
   * I think Moff kills Bo, and then Din kills Moff and reclaims the Saber. Makes sense given what John and Pedro say in this [video](https://youtube.com/shorts/9JMiHfRDGbA?feature=share)
* **Large Monster**: The seemingly random appearance of a large monster emerging from the ground might foreshadow the Mythosaur's surprise appearance at the end of the season.
   * Grogu could potentially tame the Mythosaur, symbolizing a significant moment in his character arc.
   * This doesnt mean that he will be Mandalore now, as he cant speak the creed. Din will serve as Mandalore until he is old enough. Din also might have the Darksaber, which will give him more clout to be Mandalore today.
* **Business Factors (Follow the $$$)**: The behind-the-scenes influences of Pedro Pascal and Katie Sackhoff reinforce the ideas in the Primary Theory.
   * **Pedro Pascal's Influence**: Pascal's popularity and success have contributed to the show's appeal. Negotiations around his salary in the first season show that Disney recognized the value of his star power and worked to keep him happy on the show. The fact that they added a scene in which his character reveals his unmasked face also shows a willingness to give Pascal the screen time he desires. Speculation about his future on the show has centered around Din Djarin potentially becoming Mandalore and appearing without his helmet more frequently, which would align with his desire for more face time on the show. Also - the rumors about drama on set is fake. See this [video message](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-d7g6QflKS8) they played at celebration. He is a class act and a professional. No chance the rumors are true.
* **Katie Sackhoff's Role**:
   * Sackhoff's enigmatic portrayal of Bo-Katan's past, combined with Pascal's influence on the show, could lead to a surprising outcome for her character's arc. Sackhoff first played Bo-Katan in The Clone Wars in 2012 and has since reprised the role in Rebels and The Mandalorian, with a total of 21 episodes across the Star Wars franchise. Unlike Pascal, her star power outside of the Star Wars universe is not as high, and it's unclear if she has a long-term contract with Lucasfilm for future projects. While her consistent appearances in the franchise suggest that she's a valuable and popular addition, her limited episode count and voice acting contracts indicate that she may not have as much negotiating power as Pascal.
   * Sackhoff was very present at SWC. I don't think the show runners would foreshadow a ""surprise ending"" and then blatantly reference that thing in the unified talk track across essentially all interviews at the conference. Also, **implying that Bo is ""The Mandalorian"" in these interviews, and then actually doing that in the show, would not be very surprising.**
* **\*\*THEY ARE A BUSINESS!:\*\*** Lucasfilm, and Disney, are businesses. They by their nature serve their stakeholders. The idea that they would make such massive changes to the show, just to make a political statement, is ridiculous. They are still trying to make Star Wars more appealing, but dont want to piss off their core fan base. They can have their cake and eat it too - Din becoming Mandalore makes the core fans happy, and still appeals to the new demographics that are key to Lucasfilms strategy seemingly.
* **Streaming Traffic:** The controversy in general this season has definitely increased streaming traffic of the show. This also serves their Stakeholders..... Season 3 episode 3 was at that point the lowest rated in IMDB but that doesn’t mean people didn’t watch it. Numbers for the episode were higher than the season two premiere (1,032 m) and all other episodes of Season 2 except for Chapter 13 (Ahsoka, sweet episode) and 16 (Luke, another gem). Numbers were also higher than Season 3 Episodes 1 and 2.

Mon Mothma has issues with the Mandalorians as much as she does with the remnants of the Empire and she is trying to kill two birds with one stone and have one or both of the treats eliminated.

Kane actually did what she did to Dr. Pershing because it was what was best for the New Republic as it put one of their major projects in jeopardy.

Koska Reeves is actually serves a similar function for Mon Mothma and the Mandalorians. She is a double agent for the New Republic among the Mandalorians and is dangerous for the Mandalorians as she reports directly to Mon Mothma.  She is the other spy we see in the episode of the Spies."
135,1681436860.0,StarWarsTheories,"Kane is working for Thrawn, not Gideon. - Kane is a double agent working for Thrawn. Not Gideon.   


So far we've seen her covering up for Gideon, but she didn't break him out. His forces did, in terms of the supercommando forces he'd been mustering on Mandalore. Gideon is emblematic of much of the issue with the Empire, at which Thrawn regularly butted heads with. Gideon has been amassing assets for years. The fact mandalore was considered destroyed and 'unreclaimable' was a coverup for Gideons opperations farming Baskar. He had darktroopers, squadrons of interceptors, slowly amassing assets that COULD have been used elsewhere numerous times but he horded power and acted with an arogance the Empire was rife with.  


The act of bombing Mandalore is evidence enough that Gideon and Thrawn would sooner kill each other than work together as equals. Thrawn would never wish to see such destruction of history, culture, infastructure, it was also POINTLESS as we just found out. Behind hiding a fascility for Gideon to acrew more power in secret. And Gideon is seemingly doing so out of purely a lust for power. I wonder if he was planning a coup before the fall of the Empire or if he was simply an opportinist claiming the forgotten projects of the Empire for himself. Either way, Gideon is a threat to Thrawn, and Thrawn would be far too aware that coming forward would only risk Gideon targeting him. So Thrawn planted Kane or recruited her once Gideon was captured. Thrawn doesn't SUDDENLY return with an army. He's probably acting within the shadows as events play out, biding his time and counting his potential allies and enemies. Taking out threats where and as he can. Thrawn could take out an enemy, make a strong show of force, and sieze a huge pool of resources, information, and perhaps even take over a large intelligence network, all in one swoop, and all whilst only rumours remain to suggest if he's either whale chum or a credible threat.

As for Kanes involvement specifically. She's been spoon feeding Gideon, but how certain are we in her actions? Would Gideon really care to have Pershing killed? Maybe if he had no other option but she clearly got him outside the eye of the republic and to a point where he could easily be taken away and nobody would know. They'd just see it as him defecting. Killing him might have just as well been to throttle Gideons plans to assemble an army. As for now when contacting him, she warned him about... The Pirates on Nevaro? The plan was probably to have the pirates take over as a cover for returning to the research fascilities from Season 2. Why would an opperative in the republic know about nor be reporting to Gideon about it's success? And if she did know about it, why not warn him that Din wasn't JUST with the Children of the Watch but also had the Nite Owls on the way too? That he'd be a MUCH bigger threat. The trail of information doesn't make any sense on it's own, how and why was Kane involved in telling Gideon. Gideon had been warned of an oncomming attempt to reclaim Mandalore but not the whole of who'd be attacking, outright shocked at the presence of both the Nite Owls and The Convent?   


I still think the armourer was likely a part of Death Watch, and is maybe the second Spy, working for Thrawn. Axe is also a good bet but neither would make sense if they worked for Gideon as he'd know the Nite Owls and The Convent were working together. Unless of course, they worked for someone else. Someone who just so happened to be set up in the very next scene after Gideon was essentially told that the Mandalorians would be going to Mandalore. And Gideon was given partial information specifically to unravel his plans and leave him vulnerable.  


Gideon being only partially informed and set up for failure by Kane, only for Thrawn to be established in the next scene and Gideons growing anxiety that he'll be attacked. The information chain makes more sense if we have a traitor in the Mandalorian camp working for Thrawn leaking information to Gideon so Thrawn can eliminate another threat.   


Unrelated kinda but, this is more a full blown fanfiction scene. It'd also be jaw dropping if we see Gideon retreat to the Shadow Council, asking for help as he's cornered, the Mandos one by one taking down the Guards stationed in the cooridoor of ray shields. Only for some of the Council to be struck down one by one with orange lightsabers, blades, and blaster fire, as the organ of ""Thrawns Theme"" begins in the background as the season perfectly sets up that the whole events were orchestrated by Thrawn, even bombing Bo-Katans house being set up BY Thrawn not Gideon to insight Din and Bo-Katan to go off to gather a force to kill Gideon.  


Season 3 could easily fit neatly into being orchestrated BY Thrawn, IE Kane leaking a misleading account of Navaro to Gideon, antagoising Bo-Katan when 'given up' retaking Mandalore, Gideon so easily escaping the New Republic yet having Dr Pershing killed when Kane had him isolated, alone, and completely trusting her. And More crutially the fact Gideon had no idea the Nite Owls and The Convent were alligned in the plan to retake Mandalore. 

**TLDR** \- Thrawn could be pulling the strings behind season 3, to isolate and kill Gideon, who's an inconvience at best and a potential threat at worst.  


PS. I'm not saying it's going to happen, but it's definitely interesting and possible as far as I've found. The loose threads would be tied up neatly by this, and it'd be a POWERFUL introduction to Thrawn legitimising him as a threat to liveaction audiences"

138,1681389606.0,StarWarsTheories,"Moff Gideon and the Armorer were part of Death Watch - So, this is a theory I got to thinking about recently I've heard theories about The Armorer being a spy and some have speculated that The Armorer was this one woman in Death Watch who was among Maul's most devout followers. Here's my theory. The Armorer and Gideon are both former Death Watch and are secretly working together. I think The Armorer joined or helped to form the The Watch to carry on the goal of restoring Mandelor's warrior culture.

However things hit a snag with the older watch members and Din adopting Grogu. I think Gideon and her have decided to cut their losses and start from scratch. So they sent Din and the others to their deaths and left only the Armorer and the loyal mandalorians to watch the children.

I think the Death Watch mandalorians still hold Maul in high regard and now wear helmets modeled after him. Which brings me to what Gideon is working on. I think he's making Zabrack warriors to act as new mandalorians. He's narcisstic but I think his helmet shows he's a major Maul follower and likely sees him as the perfect warrior.

I suspect in his heart Gideon sees himself still as a Mandalorian it's likely he joined the empire as everything else fell apart and became a Moff after Mandalore fell."

So we know that the Praetorian Guards are a blend of purge troopers and imperial red guard but I think in chapter 23 of The Mandalorian we were given clues that more is going on in the remnant.

Moff Gideon mentioned several groups they are borrowing from, Jedi, mandalorian and cloners. Now he is talking about this while showing off his new armour (the mandalorian influence) and he was trying to claim the darksaber (the Jedi influence) this leaves the cloners. 

I have thought the white dark troopers armours are the clones with Mandalorian armour but where is the Jedi influence?

Now the praetorian guards on the other hand have armour, wield weapons that are energy based and are very uniform in size and shape. It could be these are the pinnacle of what Gideon is trying to do en mass.

If this is true who are they clones of? I think if they are cloning it will be someone who is force sensitive, Mandalorian or both.

So it could be palpatine, anakin or Luke but if it was both there are two people I can think that have both Jedi and mando “influence”:

Korkie and Ezra 

Let me know what you think and I know the Korkie idea is a fan theory too but would be nice and tragic if it was confirmed in one go."

First, the obvious parts: the horns on her helmet and the color of her armor. Those have been the basis of the theory for some time now. But why wasn't she at the Forge? They over-emphasized the fact that she was flying the ship away from the action. Also, she hinted at the fact that she was a member of Death Watch, by both explaining how Death Watch fractured, as well as explaining that she was on Concordia when the purge happened. Also, with the episode title being ""The Spies,"" how did the Imperials know that the Mandalorians were joining forces? Obviously the fact that spies is plural infers that there are more, and I think that the wounded Mandalorians on the surface are also spies. I think that for next week's episode, we are also going to get some Children of the Watch followers revealing their adoration for Maul, or at the very least, a reveal that some (including the Armorer,) were a part of that faction."

When Moff Gideon defends to meet Mando he gives one hell of an awesome and terrifying speech during which he says,

“I have created the new generation of dark troopers. The most impressive improvement is that it has me in it!”

Now here’s my theory. Moff Gideon’s new generation of dark troopers are force sensitive clones of himself wearing mandalorian beskar armor. 

Earlier in the episode we see that he has tanks, presumably with clones in them just like the ones seen in the previous season when his base on Navarro is attacked. His connections to Dr. Pershing are obvious and of course he was a client who was experimenting on Grogu. Theories for this are of course that the the Empire/Imperial Remnant/First Order are creating force sensitive clones. While Snoke is an obvious choice for this it’s obvious that Gideon isn’t working with the first order and Hux is working on project Necromancy completely separate from what Gideon is doing. So what is he using cloning for then? To build an army reminiscent and superior to that of the Grand Army of the Republic. But Jango Fett obviously won’t work again, so who is he cloning to build this army? HIMSELF! 

Moff Gideon is paranoid and narcissistic so who better to be the perfect army than an improved version of yourself?"

145,1681318736.0,StarWarsTheories,"WOLVES WILL BRING THE TWILIGHT AND THE DAWN OF THE FORCE - Excuse my english, it's not my main language. And sorry for the loooong text.

Yesterday I started thinking better about Ahsoka's trailer. Over the years reading books and comics from the new canon I had some theories and ideas, they are extremely speculative, and that's why I never shared them, but now with this trailer some points ended up connecting and I decided to share a part of my speculations. Those are not plot theories, but mostly deductions on Star Wars lore, and mainly involving the Jedi and the new characters Baylan and Shin.

I know there's a lot of holes in those theories, and it still needs some maturation. I decided to leave aside some other ideas that I had, that maybe could complement, but I still don't quite know how to make the right connections.

Firstly, we now know that the last names of the orange-lightsaber wielders are Skoll and Hati, obviously referencing Norse mythology. I honestly don't know much about Norse cosmology, but some symbolisms seem very interesting if we connect with Star Wars as a whole.

**BRIEF CONTEXT ABOUT NORSE WOLVES**

In short, in Norse mythology, there is a prophecy saying that Loki's children (who are Jormungandr, Hela and **Fenrir**) would bring many problems, such as the destruction of the cosmos during Ragnarok.

To prevent this, Odin orders each of Loki's children to be separated and imprisoned. Fenrir, who was a wolf, was tricked and chained by the gods with an enchanted rope. **Skoll** and **Hati** are the children of this wolf Fenrir and they have been told that the enchanted cord that is binding Fenrir can be destroyed if total darkness takes hold.

So, to bring the darkness and free their father, Skoll and Hati chase the Sun and the Moon every day to destroy them.

At **Ragnarok** they finally swallow the Sun and Moon, freeing Fenrir and other monsters. The wolf ends up causing great destruction and takes revenge on the gods. And before being killed he devours Odin.

Ragnarok is the final battle of the gods against the giants and Loki. In this war the dead warriors of Valhalla will join the gods against the giants, who in turn will have support from the dead in Hel. This war culminates in the end of the world which is actually also his rebirth.

Now let's go to the theories.

**THE JEDI LIGHT CRUSADE**

I believe that sometime in the Old Republic, the Jedi Order promoted a Crusade against the dark side. In that period a prophet predicted that there will be an Age of Doom in the Force brought by the dark side itself and so the Jedi began to chase the dark side users to avoid this supposed chaos.

But to imprison all the dark side in the galaxy they also needed to go after the various traditions that practice it and ""mutilate"" them. They went from planet to planet imprisoning dark side users and their entities. The Jedi also tried to rewrite the beliefs of many cultures so that they would no longer follow the dark side of the Force. 

However, I believe that actually this Light Crusade ended up becoming the **Hundred-Year Darkness**, and the Sith Order was created in this exact moment to confront the Jedi Order, then beginning the Sith Wars.

The Sith Order was created after a catastrophic battle that severely damaged the Sith species in some way. The Sith species didn’t accept the Jedi ""catechism"" and believed that the indoctrination imposed by the Jedi was outrageous. This started a war in which a good part of the warriors of the Sith people were decimated. 

Then a group of rebellious Jedi revolted with the acts of the Jedi Order decided to abandon their ways, allying with the dwindling forces of the Sith and finally founding the Sith Order.

Many of the religions the Jedi persecuted before and during the HYD also practiced what they believed as the balance, and because they could no longer explore the dark side, they were forced to use solely the light side.

Due to this persecution, many of the religions took refuge in the Unknown Regions and managed to hide there, others joined the Sith Order. And with many of the dark side or even the balance sanctuaries abandoned, the Jedi felt the need to suppress the influence of the dark side, building their Jedi Temples on top of the shrines of those ancient religions, as they did with the ancient Sith shrine on Coruscant.

But after this Crusade another prophecy was predicted, that there would be a Chosen One who would bring balance to the Force. This could mean that despite their efforts to imprison the dark side entities and users, including the Sith, they would be released sometime and could return. 

Here I leave a prophecy by an ancient Jedi mystic in Master and Apprentice by Claudia Gray: ***“Only through sacrifice of many Jedi will the Order cleanse the sin done to the nameless.”***

Perhaps the nameless does not refer to the ""Nameless"" of the High Republic, but rather to the many religions and traditions persecuted by the Jedi Order, which are now nameless, cultless, and without records about them.

**MANDALORIAN VAULTS**

This is a BIG stretch and it clashes with another theory of mine, so maybe it's hugely incorrect. But I imagine that for the arduous task of arresting dark side Force users during the Jedi Light Crusade and the Hundred-Year Darkness, the Jedi needed the support of expert forgers and their rare ores, so they made deals with the Mandalorians and together created prisons like the Mandalorian Vaults. Note that this was a long time before the war between Mandalorians and Jedi.

Those vaults were custom-made for each entity and powerful dark side users. They were made with a **light side tuned beskar** that blocks the dark side of the Force. But some time later, in the Mandalorian Wars, the Vaults began to be used against the Jedi as well.

Perhaps the Mandalorians accepted this task to learn more about the Jedi and the Force weaknesses.

**THE PACK OF LOTHAL**

The religion of Lothal, which I will call here as **The Pack**, was one of the traditions that envisioned and committed itself to the balance of the Force. The Pack also worshiped the Loth-wolves and their cult derived from the doctrine dedicated to the Force Wielders of Mortis and therefore had a temple dedicated to them, with an entrance to the World Between Worlds.

I believe that WBW is like the **Yggdrasil** from Norse mythology, and is represented by the Father, meaning the Balance. While the Daughter would be at one end of WBW as the counterpart of the Norse **eagle Hraesvelgr**, the light side, and at the other end of the WBW lies the Norse **dragon Nidhogg**, the dark side.

So when the Light Crusade arrived on Lothal, the Jedi Knights identified the entity of the dark side there in the form of a giant wolf, the **Fenrir**. I guess it makes sense to think that Lothal's dark side powerful user or entity is a loth-wolf. So Fenrir was captured and locked up by the Jedi Order, maybe within a type of Mandalorian Vault, and the wolf's followers were decimated.

However, The Pack was one of the religions that managed to escape to the Unknown Regions. But there they are feeling incomplete without Fenrir, their patron of the dark side. Wanting to bring back their balance to the Force, they decided to eclipse the light side of the Force, to cause a great ominous darkness that would empower Fenrir and he could be freed cracking the light tuned beskar Vault.

A prophecy from Master and Apprentice: ***“The danger of the past is not past, but sleeps in an egg. When the egg cracks, it will threaten the entire galaxy.”***

**ECLIPSE KNIGHTS**

Already hidden in the Unknown Regions, the Pack created a sect in their own religion that portrays the **Twilight and the Dawn of the Force**, a duo that I will call the Eclipse Knights. They are presented solely by two agents, Skoll and Hati. They wield orange sabers to express the Dusk and Dawn, indicating the end of light, but also the perpetuation of cycles. Or simply the balance. So there can be only two Eclipse Knights, when Skoll dies Hati must become Skoll and a new sensitive must become Hati.

The Force-sensitive Hati must encourage her own hatred, letting the dark side flow. In Norse mythology, Hati is also called **He Who Hates**. And then when a Hati becomes a Skoll they need to soften the hatred and be calmer, ensuring the balance between the two.

Baylan and Shin are the current Eclipse Knights and I believe they will trigger some events that will be important for the entire saga. Maybe they've been looking for Fenrir for a long time, and they're the first Eclipse Knights who came closest to finding a way to free him, and now in the Ahsoka series they're going to find that way.

**THE FOOL CRYSTAL**

An interesting thing that I think goes well with the wolf mythology is the kohlen crystal, which was also called the “fool's crystal” by Qui-Gon in the book Master and Apprentice. They are Force crystals similar to Kyber, but they act differently. They give an orange shade to the blades of sabers, apparently they don't cauterize and are much less potent, they just lacerate, and if I remember correctly they can make the flesh bleed. Maybe Baylan and Shin have kohlen crystals, but learned to correctly attune them to their sabers, making them lethal, or maybe their crystals still act naturally. So, when Ahsoka sees the strange saber wounds, she goes to Huyang to learn more about this kyber that is not kyber. There she could learn more about Baylan and Shin and go after them.

Qui-Gon remembers a prophecy when he sees these kohlen crystals: ***“When the kyber that is not kyber shines forth, the time of prophecy will be at hand.”***

Symbolically, ""Fool"" can also be one of the characteristics of **Loki**, the trickster god, and father of the wolf Fenrir. Fool is also the first Tarot card that begins the Major Arcana cycle.

Also the orange color reminds me of dusk and dawn, the setting and the rise of the sun. Eclipses are distinguished by the color orange too, a lunar eclipse causes the moon to take on shades of orange, and a solar eclipse brings out a thin orange line circling the sun. Both eclipses are harbingers of darkness in some beliefs.

**THE TWILIGHT OF THE FORCE**

Baylan and Shin are the current Eclipse Knights in Ahsoka, and I believe they will trigger the Era that will be called Twilight of the Force. It will start with a great, sinister darkness in the Force that will free Fenrir. Also, other entities and dark side users imprisoned by the Jedi order will take the opportunity to break free too. 

All these beings will be filled with hatred and want their revenge against the Jedi and the Light. This will be the beginning of the Doomsday to Star Wars. The fulfillment of the prophecy that the Jedi of the past thought they had prevented with the Light Crusade, but in reality it was them who caused it.

During this Era, Rey will have her Order already established, and will have uncommon powers and knowledge that came from the ancient Jedi texts that were written before the Hundred-Year Darkness. It was established at the end of the sequels that Rey is able to communicate with past Jedi that joined the Force. I believe that in addition to communicating, she could somehow summon them in the last galactic war against the dark side that was brought by Fenrir. The **Star War**.

It would be a long and cosmic war equivalent to **Ragnarok**, where Odin's forces, along with the Aesir, Vanir and Valhalla warriors confront Loki, giants and their children. And at the end of that war comes a new beginning.

**THE DAWN OF THE FORCE**

The events that will follow will bring the Balance to the Force, brought by the Skywalker family itself, invoked directly from the Cosmic Force by Rey during the end of the last star war. Thus begins a new Dawn of the Force. And this new Dawn will paradoxically connect with the old Dawn of the Jedi, which took place 35,000 years ago, in some ""cosmic"" way. Perhaps through the use of the World Between Worlds, the Yggdrasil of Star Wars.

Here I leave another prophecy from Master and Apprentice: **“When the Force itself sickens, past and future must split and combine.”**

I think the timeline will not end with this, but will open a new cycle of stories. I don't know, there are many possibilities after that. Perhaps with the Force rebalanced and flowing through all the galaxy, the edges can finally be crossed and new frontiers and conflicts will emerge from beyond.  


  
So what you think of that? I know a lot of what I speculate won't come true, but I believe there might be some truth to the Star Wars lore somehow."

147,1681263614.0,StarWarsTheories,"There are more Sith lines than just the line of Bane - So this is my theory about how we could see the Sith return in the future. I believe Dath Bane's line was just one line of Sith. I think it's more than likely that 1000 years ago other sith survived and went into hiding. I mean there were many of them at one point and the sith are far more tenacious and prone to secrecy than Jedi. Given that it's very possible some Sith went into hiding and continued their lines in secret unbeknownst to Bane or his line.

Heck the Clone Wars shows how different lines can even split from one. We saw Ventress and Savage Oppress. At any point in the last 1000 years a sith could have thought he killed an apprentice, and that apprentice could have survived and started a line of their own. Plus with the fall of the Jedi any sith in hiding had their pick of potential apprentices.

In hindsight Palpatine's actions made him easy to hid from. If more secretive and stealthier sith could sense him (he wasn't really hiding) then knowing his nature and motives it'd have been easy to avoid him.

I think a good twist would be for the Brotherhood of Darkness to still be around and to have been rebuilding it's strength in secret after all this time.

That's just one thought to really there are many ways sith could make a comeback but I am partial to the idea that Bane's line wasn't the only one out there."

151,1681075615.0,StarWarsTheories,"Luke is the rightful owner of the Darksaber during the Mandoverse era - A few spoilers for the Mandalorian S3 EP6!!!

So I’ve seen some theories on the technicalities of what it means to own the darksaber, granting all the rights to be the ruler of mandalore. The way I’ve seen it explained is that the previous owner of the darksaber has to be beaten in a duel, this can include being disarmed and escaping. In the latest Mando episode it’s explained that technically Din lost the darksaber when he was ambushed on Mandalore by the fish monster, who was then defeated by Bo-Katan and thus gaining control of the Darksaber. If it’s that simple to change hands, I’d argue that Luke has a more legitimate claim to the darksaber despite never seeing it and I’ll explain my view of the line of succession:

Starting point - Pre Viszla who was the earliest known owner of the Darksaber (other than his ancestor Tarre hundreds of years prior)

Owner 1: Pre Viszla, who defeated by Maul on Mandalore
Owner 2: Maul, who is defeated by Palpatine on Mandalore, losing his brother in the process 
Owner 3: Palpatine, who is defeated by Mace Windu on Coruscant (regardless of your views of whether he let him win or not, Mace still disarmed him which fits the requirements)
Owner 4: Mace Windu, who is disarmed(literally) by Anakin and killed by Palpatine on Coruscant(I believe the disarming takes priority over the killing, as Windu was no longer a combatant)
Owner 5: Anakin, who is defeated by Obiwan on Mustafar 
Owner 6: Obi-Wan, who is defeated by Vader  on Mapuzo
Owner 5(again): Vader, who is defeated by Obi-Wan on an unknown moon
Owner 6(again): Obi-Wan, who is defeated by Vader aboard the Death Star
Owner 5(again): Vader, who is defeated by Luke aboard the second Death Star 
Owner 7: Luke Skywalker

Even if we count Palpatine as the successor over Windu, Vader still kills him and Luke gets it by default. Now I know Vader occasionally gets beat in the comics, but I don’t know the specifics so I’d have to look back. 

Anyway just some food for thought. If this is right, then technically Sabine, Bo, Gideon, and Din never came close to having a claim on being the next Mandalore."

They've  made a deal with Thrawn, who recognizes the Force as his blindspot, just  like in the novels. Either way, I hope there's more nuance to these  characters than simply making them unambiguously evil. Think less like  Sith and more like the League of Shadows from Batman Begins: Evil, but from  their perspective righteous warriors pursuing Justice."

Ashoka's presence is obviously one difference from the original, and since she's a character who wasn't around in all the original expanded universe stuff post original trilogy, it could be assumed that Vader just killed her in the Sith temple in Rebels. Ezra going to that space-in-between in the Force to travel back in time and save her could  have caused a divergence in the timeline. This could be touched upon in universe as a cannon reason for why things are different from the original novels, and could be analogous to one of DC Comics reboots like Crisis On Infinite Earths or Flashpoint; where a retcon is actually acknowledged by the characters to a degree."

155,1680886691.0,StarWarsTheories,"Ahsoka Theory - So, obviously, they are hinting at a similar story to the Thrawn Trilogy. Baylon is the stand-in for Jorus C'baoth, and I believe that female dark Jedi is the canon answer to Mara Jade. I also think that those ships we see in the trailer could be a part of the Katana Fleet. But, there's no way that Thrawn is coming to retake the galaxy for Palpatine. I don't think he's part of the cloning story at all. He wants to retake the galaxy because he believes he is the only one who can stop the Grysk. Thrawn is going to attempt to forcefully take the New Republic so that he can use all resources available to him to destroy the Grysk. 

Mon Mothma appears in the trailer. She will recognize the threat Thrawn poses but will not give any resources to help Ahsoka, simply because the New Republic disarmed. One thing I am eager to see is how Ezra will fit into all of this. Will he join Thrawn's side? Also, they went to the Unknown Regions, so did they go to the Ascendancy? How will the Chiss fit into all of this? Overall, I am very excited about this show, and it's clear they are setting up a wider fight against the Grysk since Dave Filoni is set to direct movies that take place in between the trilogies."
156,1680876469.0,StarWarsTheories,"Two Sabine Wren in a Split Timeline - After watching Ahsoka's Teaser Trailer... I'm beginning to doubt that the trailer shows something that everyone doesn't know...
There are three frames of the trailer that are hinted at...

it's snippets for the minutes 0:23,0:25,0:42,0:45 and 1:20...I noticed that Sabine's hair is different...and she does not wear Mandalorian armor, although in the Rebels in the epilogue she wears ...

and this indicates to me that this is another Sabine...in fact themselves, the Rebel Animated Series Ezra discovered the World Between Worlds ... and he Saved Ahsoka .. yes, it's still the same Ahsoka .. but still ...


So, what if Ezra is from saving Ahsoka.. He may have violated the Timeline of the Star Wars Universe...


This is indicated by the words of the new character Baylan...To whom he said ""This is a new beginning.For some war.. for others power""

maybe he means Allegedly World Between Worlds...but isn't it strange to seem that he is..a hint that Baylan...It's Ezra...only different...

firstly, if you look at the footage where Baylan turns on the lightsaber .. then the hilt looks like Ezra's hilt
which means it’s possible .. Ezra didn’t just survive ... he became a different person ... and even his hair is not the same as in the Rebels ...


which means Ezra became cursed because of the action of the world between worlds ... he clearly broke the Timeline .. of the Universe ... Hence the Mandalorian Series and In the Boba Fett Book ... Where Ahsoka mentioned Thrawn ... but in a conversation with Din. .she didn't mention Ezra...

But if you watch the Rebel Epilogue and Ahsoka's Teaser Trailer... But you can see that these are two different timelines...

Firstly, Ahsoka in the Animated Series, she wears a white robe like Gandalf ... Secondly, Sabine Wears Mandalorian Armor ... But in the trailer she does not wear ...

which indicates that Ezra may have changed the timeline...if in one timeline Ahsoka didn't survive the fight with Darth Vader..And in the other timeline she is alive and well....


then that Sabine from The Animated Series did not know that Ahsoka was alive ... but in season 4 ... when Loth wolf put Sabine to sleep ...when she woke up.. she said ""I don't remember what I saw either but I heard you say wolf""

it seemed that this phrase had no meaning, but ... the white wolf may have allegedly shown or not ... the future ...Yes, Sabine is not a Jedi of course ... but she clearly does not know what others are ...

And perhaps there will be a mention of the multiverse ... If Sabine from the Series sees her version from the Animated Series ...which means Ahsoka can also see her cartoon version..

if from Sabine the Rebels animated series somehow does not know that Ahsoka is alive ..

That For Sabine from the series Ahsoka..it seems like a few years have passed for her..and given that the characters can grow old...


Isn't it a hint that Sabine from the TV series somehow knew about Ahsoka ... rather than Sabine from the Animated series, which Ahsoka barely knew during the Second season of the Rebels ... Ahsoka Didn't interact with Sabine .. only somewhere in the comics they interacted ...

but in later seasons of Rebels...Ezra didn't mention Ahsoka as dead.until the fourth season of Rebels...until he discovered the World between Worlds...


And in Ahsoka's trailer, Sabine doesn't mention her family..so her clan is somewhere dead on Mandalore or alive ..Which means Sabine probably doesn't know what happened on Mandalore...


and why did I say that Sabine can be in two timelines...if in one timeline she Lives and wears Mandalorian Armor..And in the other timeline she does not wear it because she ceased to be a Mandalorian..


and maybe in Ahsoka's finale, Sabine learns the truth from Ezra..she might bury everything possible relationship with him...or not...because Baylan might turn out to be Ezra...whom he became on the dark side...and who he may have been brainwashed..and what's more, he could have his apprentice...But Thrawn is out of the question...


but perhaps my assumption that Sabine exists in two timelines .. clearly speaks of this ...


maybe the original version of Sabine knows that Ezra is alive..but she doesn't know if Ahsoka is alive...whereas the TV version of Sabine probably knows that Ahsoka is alive...


but let's look purely from the point of view of Franchises and the point of view from the other ..


On the one hand, we see how the authors are trying to explain everything about what is happening with the Star Wars Canon ... which is trying to sit on two chairs listening to the agenda ... and thereby destroying that Star Wars universe ... because recently an episode from the 3rd season of The Mandalorian ..showed that the Star Wars universe begins to die, ceases to be interesting ...


because we know that the box office John Wick 4 showed that Disney, Warner Bros, Netflix, Amazon and also like Lucasfilm .. they can’t create anything new ... they use the same storylines .. the same story but they can’t create a new one...They go on the same rake mistakes...trying to tie in with the Star Wars sequel trilogy...


but on the other side of the Star Wars universe, an eventual restart of the universe and the timeline is needed..




you know, there is a phrase from the legendary Tolkien ... who said ...and this is a perfect description of what is happening not only with the Star Wars universe but also with other franchises.. He Said

""Evil cannot create anything new, it can only spoil and destroy what good forces have invented or created.""

and this is so ... but from the point of view of the Star Wars universe itself ...


I have such an assumption .. that the Force that everyone uses...begins to die..because the Force is Everything everywhere and at once...it began to weaken...the Force begins to weaken..The past and the future begin to merge..


even one of the prophecies said..""When the Force itself sickens, past and future must split and combine.""

So the Loth Wolf of the rebels said that restore the past, redeem the future...not Ahsoka, but the Star Wars universe itself...And Ezra not understanding these words, he thought about Ahsoka ... but he did not know that the universe did not notice the violation ...and the Force began to perhaps realize that the Jedi and Sith were destroying the Force...

Maybe the Force doesn't have minds... but maybe other beings feel...And the Force begins to look for the one who starts a new one .. just Sabine Is the one who obviously does not know about the Force, Any such ...

and maybe even Sabine doesn't know about the Multiverse...If the Original Sabine doesn't start to understand this...sooner or later...then the other versions will start to make everything bad..will begin to move away from those characters that we know from the animated series and films ...

And Sabine begins to understand that her world is starting to fade...that the New Republic cannot cope..and they are engaged in some kind of garbage..what the Mandalorian series showed ... what the new republic does just like the Empire ..


Which means Sabine will have to leave the Star Wars universe to find a new home...and the chances that Sabine will leave the Star Wars universe and move to another universe are extremely zero...


And We know that Star Wars is not the same anymore ... it's more a franchise than the universe that Lucas created ..and because of Disney, they just start to break that canon and history ... And depreciating those characters and the Universe ... they start to get disappointed ...and it's time to separate Sabine Wren into a separate universe...and it would be cool to see how Sabine leaves the Star Wars universe through the Portal...and where she will look for a new home for herself...it will be a logical move but also at the same time letting go of Dave Filoni from Sabine as a creation...

Because Dave Filoni Created her...and it'd be cool if he let her go...because fans can do things that even the best fans can't.
film studios..just watch the video from the High Ground Animations Channel...

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c5MLuVJHoGA&ab_channel=HighGroundAnimations

Fans do a lot better than Lucasfilm...

even Lucasfilm forgot how to make games .. others make them for them ...

Now, if they would make a game about Sabine Wren... then the game would be like the old God of war games...

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5lK3Q14uWoM&ab_channel=MKIceAndFire

but about the theory that Sabine can be in two timelines... but in different versions of her life

it will remain so such a theory ... maybe not so crazy ... but a theory.


yes, I talked a little about all sorts of fantasies ... but these are my Wishlists ... and if my Wishlists come true or not come true ... then I’m a fantasy in vain .."
157,1680794117.0,StarWarsTheories,"Rey is the owner of the darksaber - Taking into consideration ""The Mandalorian"" Season 3 Episode 6, it is logical to assume that whoever defeats the wielder of the Darksaber becomes the new owner of the weapon, regardless of whether they use it in battle or not. This allows us to create a timeline of ownership, based solely on canon.

Beginning with Pre-Vizsla, who is the first known owner of the Darksaber in canon, we see that he loses the weapon to Darth Maul in ""The Clone Wars"" series. Later, Ahsoka defeats Maul, which means the timeline looks like this:

Pre-Vizsla → Darth Maul → Ahsoka

However, the ownership of the Darksaber becomes somewhat unclear after this point. In ""Star Wars Rebels,"" Ahsoka supposedly loses to Darth Vader in a temple, making him the new owner of the weapon. As we know from the original trilogy, Luke Skywalker ultimately defeats Vader, and in the sequels, he loses a spiritual battle to Kylo Ren. Kylo Ren, in turn, loses to Darth Sidious in ""The Rise of Skywalker,"" and finally, Rey defeats Sidious, resulting in the following ownership timeline:

Pre-Vizsla → Darth Maul → Ahsoka → Darth Vader → Luke Skywalker → Kylo Ren → Darth Sidious → Rey

Despite inconsistencies in the sequels, this ownership timeline seems accurate based on canon?"
158,1680488979.0,StarWarsTheories,"The Ghost, Rise Of Skywalker, and Ahsoka - In the same vein that we see The Clone Wars, Rebels, and now Bad Batch flesh out and ""fix"" the prequels, I think Ahsoka will aim to triage Rise Of Skywalker, at least slightly.

Seeing Zeb in Mandalorian, and the continued rumours of Sabine, Hera, and Ezra floating around regarding the new Ahsoka series, I think we're going to see the ""1000 ships"" battle at the end of RoS from the perspective of the Ghost and Hera/Chopper/Zeb/Sabine/whomever else. Being in cockpit, watching them participate, even getting comms from Poe or Lando or any other cameo, would be the perfect opportunity to tie up ends and continue the trend of Mando and BoBF, in fleshing out bits and pieces that, to the casual viewer might just be cool and interesting, but to fans would be an amazing Easter egg.

I'm guessing that battle will be the final arch of Ahsoka's series, or work towards that end. The show could build up to it to with filling in plot holes from the sequel trilogy, and expanding on what else was going on or what other people/factions were doing as the New Republic was waning and the First/Final Order was rising.

I wouldn't be thinking this if anyone but David Filoni was at the helm of this cinematic universe, but this kind of story connecting has him written all over it."

Firstly, Sabine would be more experienced and stronger in combat than Ezra, so she could deal with obstacles in the World Between Worlds more effectively.

Secondly, Sabine would also have a unique ability to use the art of war, which could help her during battles and confrontations with the magical creatures of the World Between Worlds.

Also, if Sabine were there instead of Ezra, then her past and personal history could be the basis for new storylines and developing relationships with other characters in the series."

However I think regardless of whether she was a Padawan or a youngling I think she was old enough to know a lot about the force but not enough to be a jedi. Hence why she sent Din to find them.

This also explains how she knew Grogu came from the Jedi. I think she still uses the force in her duties as a Mandalorian. She also tends to talk and conduct herself like a Jedi she never gets emotional."
161,1680173406.0,StarWarsTheories,"Tech alive - theories (Star Wars Bad Batch) - Good afternoon. I would like to present my theory about the Bad Batch series. As you probably know, many of you were surprised by the scene when Tech falls with the cable car into the abyss, which meant death for him, but I think on the other hand that he could have survived and I have theories for this:

1. Tech fell and was captured by Imperial stormtroopers, who were sent to Ord Mantel by order of Dr. Hemlock, where he resides in some separate room not seen in Episode 16 for his experiments. When negotiating with Hunter, Hemlock had to lie about Tech's death because he couldn't let any clones get past his dubious research. Even if Hunter gave him Omega, he and Wreceker would still be trapped by Hemlock in the lab.
2. Tech fell but managed to escape the Imperial stormtroopers. Unfortunately, he can't run too fast because he's injured, so he decides to find shelter and contact Clone Force 99 to get back to his people.
3. My third theory might be a bit crazy, but I still think it could be put here as something that could happen in season three. Tech dies after falling off the cable car, causing Omega to feel angry and sad. Omega learns a lot about himself and Clone Force 99 while on Ord Mantell which causes him to think about turning back time. Crosshair and Omega escape the research facility on Ord Mantell and rejoin Clone Force 99. One day, the Clone Force 99 get a mission from a Jedi Knight who asks them to help stop a group of Neo-Sith (non-Imperial) who are trying to take control of one of the Jedi temples, where there is a portal to a world between worlds in order to control the universe. The group of Neo-Sith's are defeated, but Omega knowing what the Jedi had said caused her to enter the world between worlds and transported herself to the point where Clone Force 99 made a plan to find Hemlock's facility and told the whole truth to the team in the past, including herself. This causes Tech to survive and CF99 did not go to Eriadu. However, this brings other consequences that Omega will have to face.

This is my theories about that how the story might unfold in season 3. I think Tech will definitely make an appearance as he is a favorite character of many fans of the series including mine. I know, maybe we are carried by emotions here, but I think that there will definitely be a Tech thread and certainly a moment when there will be all six in Clone Force 99 and maybe other clones that they saved."
162,1680169091.0,StarWarsTheories,"S3 Mando Thrawn Theory - Thrawn will have a ""Thanos like"" cameo at the end of Mando S3.  Essentially an Imperial Officer, possibly even Elia Kane, having finally broken away from the New Republic, will approach him, make a report, and he will be revealed, whereupon he will say something to the effect of ""everything is going according to plan.""

I'm not 100% sure how much I would want to see that, if for no other reason because it may be a bit too predictable, though a cameo would be an ""upgrade"" from the name drop that he got in Season 2.  But though it is a kind of upgrade, it's still teasing, and you can only tease your audience for so long.  I know this may come across as a bit entitled, but I'm about ready for the teasing to stop and for these characters to take a more active role in the story.  Yes, we all expect him to appear in Ahsoka, but maybe I've gotten a bit restless after 5 years, as have many others.  We'll see how things go, hopefully they'll be able to put the plot threads together and come up with something great, all we can do is wait for now.

163,1680135015.0,StarWarsTheories,"Omega&Emerie The Clone Sisters(TBB S.3 Theory) - So, as the finale of the second season of the Bad Batch just aired, I wanted to post a theory I have about the last scene in the 16th episode of season 2. Emerie says to Omega ""I am your sister"". A sentence which confused me at first but then lead to quite the interesting idea: Omega and Emerie are the products of a cloning program of the Advanced Science Division. It all started off with Palpatine wanting to clone the Zillo Beast during season 2 of TCW. He couldn't let that be done by the Kaminoans, out of fear of being exposed. So he tasked the ASD with cloning the Zillo beast via their own cloning program, which of course had to be created first. So the ASD created a first batch of experimental clones out of Jangos DNA with Omega being the only one which survived. Her altered appearance is due to flaws in the genetic material. Since Omega then would be the only source of semi-reliable genetic material, they then took her DNA and tried to create another clone, which because of further corruption of the genetic material would look nothing like Omega. This clone then would be Emerie who, thanks to accelerated aging, would be a lot more grown up then Omega, despite being ""born"" after her. Thanks to these ""accomplishments"" the ASD would then be beginning to clone a new Zillo beast. Obviously Omega landed on Kamino due to some mysterious circumstances with the ""sister"" Emerie remaining with the ASD and becoming the right hand of Dr. Royce Hemlock. This could also explain why Emerie hesitated to hit the alert when Crosshair tried to break out.

164,1680098762.0,StarWarsTheories,"Mando season 3 plot Theory - With the most recent episode of The Mandalorian, it was revealed that Moff Gideon's shuttle was ambushed by people who made use of Mandalorian alloy or planted it. While it is possible that Gideon was rescued by Imperial aligned mandalorians/Imperials that make use of the alloy (and the tie fighters might suggest that) I would like to propose a different fun theory:

Mandalorians ambushed Moff Gideon's shuttle knowing that he had taken the Dark Saber from Bo.

If this is the case, it would be fun if Moff Gideon traded information on the who has the saber now for his release, or something similar, and now that mandalorian is looking for Din to fight him and take the blade for himself. This would tie in the Dark Saber, the journey to reunify the mandalorians, and the imperial plot on the outer rim, which is most of the plot points introduced in the show so far.

Following this theory, this is where I really want the show to go:

1. Episode 6: has Mando meet the bad mandalorians and they try to get the Dark Saber. Things do not go well.
2. Episode 7: Bo takes Mando to meet Sabine so he can figure out how to use the gosh darn saber and win a fight with it.
3. Episode 8: 2nd encounter with Din and Evil Mando, Din actually wins his fight using the Dark Saber, after a lot of difficulty. Bo uses Din's victory to unite the mandalorian people. Moff Gideon probably gets away or otherwise sets up for the next struggle that Din and Grogu will have to face.

Honestly? This is probably wishful thinking. I just want to see Din and Sabine meet, and Filoni is listed as helping in Episode 7 so if there was any time when Sabine would show up, that would be it. Still, it would be pretty cool if it happened!

I think this is why the Armorer tells Bo Katan to remove her helmet.

But thinking about the whole situation, Palpatine ordered the attack on the Temple, and it wasn't really yet known that order 66 had started by the Jedi Standpoint.  

So my theory is, that Palpatine knew that there were strong force sensatives in the temple that would be useful to him. He couldn't tell Vader to kill all the Jedi at the temple ""but save this one and that one for me"".  He had to devise another plan to get out the younglings he seemed fit for his experiments i.e. Grogu, being of the same race as Yoda.  So is it possible that the Naboo Yacht that rescued Beq and Grogu was in fact one of the Supreme Chancellor's Naboo Yachts (or Jar Jar's yacht acting under the request of Palpatine), and the friends that Beq referred to were people close to the chancellor?

To me this makes more sense than just a random rescue from Padme (who didn't know what was going on at the time) or Jar Jar (who was already under the sway of Palpatine already.

I have a hunch that Grogu and and Din will both learn Anzellan so Grogu can speak to Din and Din can understand him.

There was also something funny and potentially foreshadow-y about Karga translating. Since the Anzellan language is fun and strange, and sounds appropriate for a small cute alien species, I think Grogu could easily develop a cute and palatable version of this language and maintain his cuteness and charm while also being able to speak to Mando. Mando would need to translate for others so the dynamic would basically stay the same.

This also kind of explains why Yoda speaks the way he does - perhaps certain types of language come very unnaturally to their species and that is why Yoda speaks with strange syntax. Maybe he learned 100 other languages and finally begrudgingly mastered Basic albeit with weird quirks, and it will take a lot of years for Grogu to be able to speak it well."
171,1679602890.0,StarWarsTheories,"Grogu and the Gungan Genocide - Ok so I'm going out on a limb on this, I haven't see anything else on the subject, but let's see what people think.

Ahmed Best is JarJar and now also the Jedi Kelleran Beq. Grogu is obviously super important, they protected him alone with four jedi and left the other younglings out to dry. Beq takes Grogu aboard a Nubian ship that looks to be the same exact ship Padme and Anakin galavant around in AotC. There are at least two Nubian ships present on Coruscant at the time of Order 66, this one, and Padme's new one--which she takes to Mustafar... it is also a different model.

This MAY now be Jar Jar's ship, and Beq is taking it, and Grogu, to hide on Naboo. With the Gungans. Underwater. Seems like a safe place to hide him, right?

Ok we also don't see JarJar again in Canon after Padmes funeral, at least not that I'm aware. I've also never seen the Gungans through the OT Era, and I also haven't seen any reference to their cities. There may be a few out there in the galaxy, but with a galaxy so large, how would one really truly ever eradicate an entire race of beings?

I think Beq takes Grogu to the Gungans, who are then invaded at some point by the empire, wiped out by Palpatine (who has a grudge against them from TPM) and Grogu is then taken by the empire until he somehow escapes and is taken by the outlaws Mando rescues him from."

We know that Thrawn is going to be at least one of the ‘Big Bads’ of the franchise as Ahsoka has mentioned that she is looking for him and his final fate has yet to be established following the finale of Rebels.
In The Mandalorian 3x3, it is mentioned, you’ll need to forgive me as I cannot remember who by, either Din or Bo-Katan says it, that there are too many TIE’s present for them to belong to an Imperial Warlord of the time. This leads me to believe that Thrawn will be making his appearance in The Mandalorian season 3 at some point, I feel that it is already a given that he will be the primary antagonist of The Ahsoka series as well.
Now to get to my point, it’s just an idle thought that I feel would be a cool reference to the EU and expand upon the new canon.
So imagine if you will, during the final battle between our heroes and Thrawn’s Imperial Remnant, that Thrawn issues his ‘Last Command’ it could be something as simple as ‘Destroy them, bring the New Republic to its knees!’ Not verbatim, but something along those lines. Naturally Thrawn has to lose for the sequels to happen, however the Empire continues on as the First Order. What if Thrawn’s ‘Last Command’ becomes the ‘First Order’ in both mandate and name? Perhaps I’m clutching at straws here, but I thought that it was a cool idea. Let me know what you guys think."

And when Snoke comes to life, I think he would be quite savage and violent and kill Dr Pershing, more or less in the same way as the Green Goblin killed the scientist after his transformation in Spider-Man 1.

178,1678445495.0,StarWarsTheories,"Direction of S3 Mando so far -  S3 Mando after Episode 2

I'm not yet ready to write the season off completely, but so far I am concerned. The first two episodes felt very much underwhelming, especially the first.

Basically the first episode was to reintroduce everyone to the characters and situation. Mostly I believe it was for those who skipped BOBF, and/or for completely new viewers. Perhaps for newbies it might make more sense but to me it felt almost completely pointless.

Essentially Din goes back to Nevarro (again) and decides that he wants to restore IG-11 to help him with his quest on Mandalore. I get that Filoni brought Maul back over Lucas' initial objections (and those of some of the fans) but Maul had no real arc or backstory in the Prequels, and as a character he truly blossomed in Filoni's care. Likewise Boba Fett was given more of a backstory in the Prequels by Lucas, also in the comics, and later in TCW by Filoni. He even got a bit of an arc with all of those. But still, because of the unceremonious way that he was killed off by Lucas in ROTJ his arc felt somewhat incomplete. Lucas himself later said that if he had known how popular Boba would become he would have given him a better exit. (This despite the fact that Lucas promoted the hell out of that character prior to Empire.) In other words, bringing him back I believe was somewhat justified, though I'm not a huge fan of BOBF (didn't hate it but I didn't like it).

IG-11 had a pretty solid arc in Season 1 of The Mandalorian, and I'm really not sure what else they can do to develop the character. No, he didn't have any real backstory, but that part isn't really necessary for that character IMO. If they can come up with something compelling that could make it all worthwhile, but it would be pretty revolutionary for a droid, and I'm not sure that they will take the time to develop a minor character to that extent. Further it does raise the concern about how serious the stakes are if every character can be ""brought back"". Yes, it worked with Maul and I believe made some sense with Boba Fett, but I do not believe that should be taken as a ""green light"" to treat characters like yo-yo's and kill them off only to bring them back. Furthermore, in the second episode Din picked up another droid that ended up doing almost nothing, bringing up the question of why he needed a droid in the first place.

A conflict was also set up with some pirates, whose design/aesthetic looked decent enough, but who unfortunately were almost completely lacking in charisma. Din Djarin and Greef Karga dealt with them fairly easily, Din later easily defeating them again in a space battle. Their leader looked like a villain from The Mighty Morphing Power Rangers, and not threatening in the least. For now, at least, they seem to be there as ""bowling pin villains"", whose only job is to be easily knocked down by the good guys, like Filoni's Stormtroopers.

I'm confused about Bo-Katan's role in the first episode. I can understand if her people abandoned her because she failed to bring back the Darksaber, and I can understand her choosing to settle in a Mandalorian castle, but was she living there just by herself with a protocol droid? What exactly was she living on? When Din came to see her she was sitting in an empty throne room, was she just staring at the walls before he came in? Did he need to walk in in order to ""activate"" her? I know many of you are angry over this ""nitpick"", but is it really a ""nitpick""? Explaining things like this I believe is what separates a serious character from a videogame NPC. This is why many have likened the story in this season so far to a videogame, with the character running around collecting fetch-quests. Yes, we can pre-suppose that Bo has some attendants at the castle, holds court with the residents of Kalevala (somewhere in Finland I presume?), and maybe there's a town nearby with some farming, but would it really hurt to show that? It doesn't have to be extensive, maybe just a few establishing shots, like they did with Andor, where we see Luthen flying over some farmland on his way to meet Cassian. Andor took ""authentically lived in"" to the next level. Because I like and respect both Favreau and Filoni it seriously pains me to say this but right now it feels like they're scaling it back.

Why Bo wanted nothing to do with Din in the first episode only to quickly come to his rescue in the second is also confusing. It might have been better to just have her go with Din straight away, he could convince her to at least inspect Mandalore, and rally her people back if she can prove it is habitable, even without the Darksaber. It didn't quite make sense that the creature that captured Din took so long with him while Grogu ran all the way back to Bo. Maybe if they arrived on Mandalore together they could have split up and when Din got in trouble Grogu could have then brough Bo-Katan.

Having said all this the second episode was a little bit better.  

I found Peli Motto’s character a little bit annoying in the previous seasons and BOBF, but here she seemed a bit better written, not quite sure why.  Maybe I’m just getting more tolerant, but the problem is that I’m not sure if there was any real good reason for Din to go back to Tatooine for the umpteenth time.  I suppose it was just to reintroduce Peli, and perhaps to introduce her to new audiences, but unless they can find a major role for that character I’m not sure that the introduction was all that necessary.  Like I said, the droid that Din picked up did almost nothing, it might have been better to skip this part of the episode.

Also I don’t know why they had to have Bo rescue Din twice in the same episode.  Maybe it would work better if Din rescued Bo the second time, so that things could be more “even” between them.  Bo had already saved Din in the previous season, their interactions aren’t too bad but I don’t exactly want to see them turning into Timmy and Lassie, or Mario and Peach (Din being Peach in this case, and Bo being Mario).

What carried the second episode for me was the on-screen chemistry between Bo and Din.  While Bo did save Din she never talked down to him or denigrated him afterwards, and he in turn didn’t seem to simp for her, but simply expressed gratitude.  Maybe they’ll never be a couple, and they certainly don’t have to be, but it’s interesting to watch them interact, learn more about each other and their respective backgrounds/cultures, and gradually learn to trust one another and develop a mutual respect.  The dialog between them was fairly well written, and Pedro Pascal in particular nailed the delivery, as he always does.  Again, they don’t have to be a couple by any means but there is a lot of potential in this relationship.  

What’s interesting is that Din had the Darksaber taken from him, and Bo then took it up and used it to free him and defeat his captor.  Does this mean that she can now claim the Darksaber for herself?  Why was this not addressed in the episode?  

Maybe it will be addressed in the next one, but that’s what troubles me about the season so far.  There doesn’t seem to be any real character or story development.  It feels like everything is being put off “for later”, and I can’t even tell what it is exactly that’s being put off.  Din found the Living Waters and bathed in them, so he fulfilled his quest (does he still need IG-11 now to help him out?).  There is no longer any need to bring Grogu back to “his kind”.  So what exactly is the conflict?  I believe things are being set up to introduce new characters; maybe Sabine, maybe Ezra, perhaps Thrawn, and likely Ahsoka if any of those three.  That’s all well and good but how does the current situation relate to what those characters are doing?  “The Madalorian” is Din’s story first and foremost, and right now it doesn’t seem to going anywhere.

I enjoyed the first season of “The Mandalorian”, and I actually liked the second season even more, and not just because of Luke’s appearance as did many others.  (Though seeing Luke certainly didn’t bother me and felt appropriate enough.)  What’s concerning is that Jon and Dave’s writing I believe ought to be improving over time, right now it feels like it’s deteriorating.

Yes, I know, it is still early in the season, and I still believe it has potential, but there aren’t that many episodes left, and they’re not making them very long it seems.  Also this doesn’t quite feel like Jon and Dave’s usual style as far as character progression, so I’m a bit concerned as to what degree they’re actually calling the shots, though I don’t want to dwell too much on conspiracy theories.  Whatever the answer to this question is it seems to indicate some kind of trouble.

In conclusion, at present, I am willing to see this through.  Even if I don’t like it I want to see where this story goes, but I do want to like it, and I want it to make sense.  I honestly hope they’re not just producing content for the sake of producing content, just to “fill up time”.  Favreau has said apparently that there will be many more seasons of “The Mandalorian”, that we’re not even halfway through.  If they can come up with a good story that can work, if not, the results could be disappointing.  Because Jon and Dave have done well in the past I believe that for now at least they still deserve some benefit of doubt, but I very sincerely hope that they live up to it."
179,1678377958.0,StarWarsTheories,"Children of the Watch origin theory - There shouldn’t be any spoilers for season 3 of the Mandalorian however I have put the spoiler tag just in case 

Basically I think that the Children of the Watch is an offshoot of Death Watch. 

Most of this is based off of the use of the word watch in both of the names which I don’t think is a coincidence. I think that the use of “children” also implies that it came from something that uses the word watch (for instance death watch or another Mandalorian organisation that uses that word). 

Now I also remember that in TCW season 2 when Death Watch first appear, I believe that Satine says that they want to make Mandalore revert to the old ways as more of a warrior tribe. 

We also see in Mandalorian season 1 that someone saves Din with blue armour similar to death watch’s armour. This armour is also similar to the armour that is worn by Bo Katan and her compatriots in season 2 of the mandalorian (I believe they are referred to as the nite owls (which I consider an offshoot of death watch after Maul takes over))

What I believe happened is that during the clone wars people felt that Death Watch didn’t go far enough with their ideology and that they should go further and follow the creed to the letter and forbid the removal of helmets and in doing so become known to other Mandalorians as being religious zealots. 

Sorry if I’m wrong or got any information wrong or if there have already been an explanation of how the children of the watch came to be."

This season is focusing A LOT on creatures. Episode one begins with Death Watch fighting a creature in the water.  We later see the Perrgil flying alongside mando. Episode 2 goes to Mandalore where we see the return of the mythosaur. It is obvious that Ezra’s character is very connected to creatures.  With Thrawn  being teased last season Ezra is bound to come into the story as well. When the creature attacked in episode one, I thought it seeemed pretty random to show the watch being attacked. But then I thought about what was happening in that scene. A foundling was being inducted into the watch. I think this represents another character (Grogu) coming into the force. The attack would be an attack from the dark side(the empire) of the force disrupting Grogu’s growth. The empire (thrawn) will be stopped by someone else, like mando stopping the creature. That someone is likely Ezra Bridger."

I'm still in the car so haven't delved much but thought I'd put the theory out there
The dark saber only goes to those who WIN the dark saber in combat and the one who wins it in combat from the current true owner will have the right to rule mandalore
Sabine got the dark saber (during combats if I recall)
Sabine GIFTED the dark saber to Bo Katan (because she wasn't ready to lead
Bo Katan lost it to Moff Gideon (wasn't hers to lose) 
Mando defeated Moff Gideon in combat (wasn't his to lose)

And that the events since the end of the rebellion and the coming shows she Sabine will learn to become the leader we all know she can be and she will be able to re-unite mandalore and they will become friends with the jedi (because let's face it Ezra and Sabine will be an item by in end)"

Significance of a force vision could include finding how to unite the the scattered mandalorians, disillusionment with the children of the watch, or discovery of a more suitable person to be the mandalore. 

If Din's midichlorian count increases then at the least we could expect him to  have increased awareness (in general and of danger), reflexes, greater precision, and insight into those around him.

190,1677072176.0,StarWarsTheories,"Could Omega actually be young Bo-Katan? - Okay, just hear me out: 

First point: The Bad Batch starts at the end of Episode III with order 66 going out to the clones. According to my research, about 20 years passes between Ep3 and Ep4... and then another three years between New Hope and Return of the Jedi. So at least 23 years pass between the start of Bad Batch and possibly when The Mandelorian series begins. 

Second point: Omega's age is estimated between 13-15 at the start of Bad Batch, So, if she lives to the end of the original trilogy... Omega would between 35 - 38, maybe even pushing 40+ when Mando and Grogu start hanging out. Katee Sackhoff is actually in her early 40s, so the age kinda fits. 

Third Point: After hanging out with the clones for so long, it's only a matter of time before Omega starts to wear her own clone trooper helmet, and grow up to become a full time member of the Batch. Odds are no one is going to believe Omega is another clone of Jango, because she's a woman. Her gender might be why people assume she's a Mandelorian rather than a clone. 

While I'm probably wrong, I still think this is an amusing idea. If Omega in fact grows up to become Bo-Katan, that makes her more like Boba Fett... a clone of Jango that wasn't age enhanced. It would also explain how Bo-Katan grew up to be a total badass; she was personally trained by the Bad Batch. 

So what do you think: Could The Bad Batch actually Bo-Katan's origin story?"
191,1676443107.0,StarWarsTheories,"Who I Believe is the True Hero Of the Original Trilogy, and maybe Force Awakens.. and The Last Jedi.. - When most people think of heros of the Star Wars franchise, they look first to Luke Skywalker, or Han Solo. Or maybe some of the more eclectic fans would say that it's R2D2 and C3P0 since most of the films follow their exploits. 

Looking solely at the original trilogy, there is one ""character"" and I say that loosely, that most of the time is overlooked. This ""character"" seems to get even the heros out of jams, and doesn't do it to get the bad guy, or even for any sort of gain or motive.  

Have you guessed it yet? I'm talking about the Millennium Falcon.. Yes you heard it, I feel that the Millennium Falcon is the true hero of the original trilogy and maybe even some of the sequel trilogy as well..  

By now you're probably thinking, this guy is nuts, how could an inanimate object be the hero?  Isn't it just a ship? 
From a certain point of view, yes, but the millennium falcon was an extensively modified corrilean light freighter, equipped with advanced navigational system and star maps that would put any ship in the galaxy to shame, so you could say it was one of a kind, and probably the most valuable ship in the starwars universe in terms of navigating out of a jam.

In terms of flyability, by watching and rewatching the movies so many times, it seems like anyone could hop into the cockpit and become a flying ace. The Falcon made okay pilots, into exceptional ones that even the best trained pilots in the galaxy couldn't keep up with, and we see this time and time again. Now I'm not knocking Han and Chewy as pilots, but keeping up with Luke and Darth Vader in the trench run, and getting a hit on Vader was no easy feat.. no normal pilots could have done it in any other ship. And Lando blowing up the second death star, way he could have maneuvered through that and lived had he not had the falcon.  Then Rey in force awakens having never Sat in the falcon's cockpit being able to fly like that (yes I know she's a force user but...) the ship clearly had an ability to react on its own in those situations.

Look the point is there had to be some sort of internal AI involved to help fly the ship, through the use of it's navigational system. I don't feel that an AI has to talk to be a smart entity. It just has to be able to react on its own without human interference which I feel the Falcon could do to an extent, which is why I put it in the same category as a droid, and why I feel it was the most important hero of the original trilogy.

193,1675791302.0,StarWarsTheories,"Almost all Pre A New Hope Media is only semi canon (ignoring disney vs legends) -   What I mean by this is that while characters like Ashoka and Rex did exist, and the events for the most part happened. The way that both the characters and events are portrayed vary wildly from installment to installment.  Because even though they're tones vary they still feel like they belong to the same world. Now it'd be easy to say that one is just propaganda and another is real I think it's much more likely that we're seeing real events from different perspectives. So let's go through it all.

The Prequel media that is almost entirely real with very little distortion are

* Republic Commando books and games
* Jedi Fallen Order
* The Bad Batch
* Andor

Prequels:New Republi historical drama made with full hindsight, it's why there's so much Vader foreshadowing in Anakin but then he suddenly becomes heroic in III, and the clones are depicted paradoxically as both heroic and villainous at the same time. They're also extremely inhuman in behavior compared to their portrayal in everything from the Republic Commando series to Disney canon. All of which is done because from the writer's point of view, they're just a trap set up for the Jedi. It's also why the full corruption of both the senate and the Jedi order are glossed over. It's also why characters often act like idiots because the outcomes are a foregone conclusion and all the information on them is second hand at best. The reason the dialogue is so strange is because it's made at least 50-100 years later so any attempt to get time appropriate syntax is gonna sound strange and stilted.

Clone Wars (2003): Republic Propaganda that depicts Jedi as war gods, and clones as unstoppable but disposable badasses, it's also very  human centric with the exception of Jedi council members. As most aliens in it are either villains, funny background characters, or noble savages. It lacks a lot of the more sinister implications of the Republic's actions because the people making it either didn't know or didn't care to tell about what happened. The reason Ashoka isn't in it is because one, showing a child soldier isn't great for PR and two, the trial over the bombing made her complicated.

&#x200B;

TCW:Ashoka and Rex both survived past Endor, so it's very likely that TCW is both of their accounts of the Clone War era that was turned into a holo drama. The show starts out light despite being in the middle of one of the worst wars the Galaxy had ever seen because they both look back on it with nostalgia after order 66. Non Arc Troopers are given a level of individuality and irreverence which doesn't make sense for people raised on Kamino... unless it was being told by an Arc Trooper who was mourning his troops. Order 66 has them become mindless murder robots, even though we know now that isn't the case. Anakin himself is also made way more heroic than he probably was, which makes sense from his Padawan's perspective. Lastly, Dooku is so evil and looks straight out of republic propaganda because that's how Ashoka and Rex remember him.

  
Obi Wan Kenobi: It's pretty much canon that Obi Wan kept a journal on Tatooine in his hut. When Luke came back it probably wouldn't be too much of a stretch for him to read it and then ask Leia about the parts that mention her. The reason the show whiplashes between very childish and silly and dark and despairing is that it's a mishmash of Leia's childhood memories and Obi Wan's journal."

Balance in the force is only ever possible when neither  light or dark side force users are in any position of major power in the galaxy. It was stated that the Jedi had become servants of the republic with the Jedi council acting as the war council and sword of galactic leaders, using their might to essentially control the morals of the republic. So the living force rose the sith power and clouded the Jedi in order to pull them from control. 

The sith then took total control through palpatine for 3 generations and the light side saw some of the strongest force users in history rise in response between anakin (corrupted but redeemed) obi wan, Luke, Ashoka and, I hate to say it, but time spent handling the force vs feats, arguably the strongest Jedi, Rey. Who seems to have no particular views on conquest. This finally bringing balance to the force by relieving galactic politics of Individuals who are able to interpret and therefore manipulate the living force and allowing the living force to guide the galaxy as intended."

Barriss learned of this fact because her Master (Luminara) served on it. Her attack was an attempt to make the Jedi Temple safe again.

201,1674027357.0,StarWarsTheories,"Yoda/Grogu *ARE* the force.. - So, a thought I've had for a while now-basically since the first season of the mandalorian-is that Yoda & Grogu's species doesn't reproduce like normal. Instead, the force itself creates them, in a time of need. I mostly based this on the comic & idea of Grandaddy Palps being the one to manipulate the Midichlorians to actually create Anakin and the aspect of the ""prophecy"", etc... But with Grogu being born the same year supposedly as Anakin, I had the thought ""what if the force created Grogu at the same time Anakin was created, in a way to balance out the act of evil done by Sidious?"" and I always kinda liked the idea & it's been my head Canon ever since, that the little green froggy lookin force users are supernaturally created for a purpose..

I get its not perfect, because obviously Anakin & Grogu never seemingly cross paths or anything, but we don't know what Grogu's purpose is, as of yet & with the whole concept of a ""force diad"" being added into the sequel trilogy, to me - it makes sense. 

Well, with this new trailer for season 3 of the mandolorian that just aired, there's a part where Peli Motto yells ""may the force be with you!"" as Din and grogu are taking off, and it instantly flashes to Grogu's face... I just got this gut feeling that Favro and Filoni are confirming my thoughts.. That Grogu  *IS* the force that is with Din... The force incarnate, essentially. I've ran this idea by some friends, the whole ""force creating Yoda & Grogu"", and they all seemed to think it makes sense, and everything that happens with little baby Yoda somehow confirms it more in my mind...

But, what are yalls thoughts? Does this make sense to anyone else? Until we get a confirmation of where their species actually comes from, I dig it.

A question I have about Nihilus..

So, Darth Nihilus is no longer a physical body, dissolves and encase his spirit in armor and robes to make some different physical form. Then eventually this new form of his dissolves into nothing after the Jedi  Exile Meetra Surik ""killed"" him. But the Wookiepedia article, and the sources, say that He encased his spirit within his armor again, (this time having no humanoid form, just armor), to survive, so you don`t kill him in a sense. All he is is just armor, they further on say that his armor was buried in Korriban. But this leaves me in the most important questions.....

Where did this armor come from? Surely it wasn`t the same one that we saw dissolve into red Dark Side energy in the game after his death. We saw nothing after that, no remains. It makes no sense.

If there was indeed armor, then how did it survive the explosion of the Ravager.

If the armor SOMEHOW survived the explosion and is floating in space, how did some random people come across it, find it, and bury it?

He was still in it during the time of the Revan novel, and, after the events of the novel, started transfering his essence into host bodies, thus creating the Emperor's Voice. We learned that he carved a ritual into his original body in stasis, so that if it were ever to be destroyed, a plague would be unleashed upon the person. My question is in Echoes of Oblivian storyline, when the player asks Darth Marr how old the plague is and how long his original body was in stasis, he said it was long before Revan's time. What? I thought he was still in his original body during the Revan novel, and yet the Echoes of Oblivian storyline contradicts it by saying he carved the plague into his original body way before Revan's time.

207,1672417429.0,StarWarsTheories,"Anyone else support the Darth R2D2 conspiracy? - It sounds ridiculous, but it shakes the foundation of the SWU. I haven't seen anyone post this after some light searching.   
What we know: The only consistent character throughout all works was R2. R2-D2 was never given a full memory wipe and never received new programming, He's had many different masters but is clearly shown as smart, stubborn, independent or just unlike other droids. His closest companion is a protocol droid. C3PO, having been wiped multiple times, doesn't remember what's going on - only what R2D2 has told him each time.  

It was no secret, that machine augmentation could preserve life, at a cost of loss of connection to the Force. Vader is the best example of this outcome.  Sidious and his minions' reliance on flesh was examined by the continued experimentation with clone tech seeking to extend both one's life and even the Force itself. This explains Gen. Grivious' curious condition and contributes to why the Sidious and Dooku would be involved with him and clone tech. 

 Darth Plegueis died on 32BBY on the evening when Palpetine was elected Chancellor (or so I have read). R2's date of manufacture is 32BBY or sometime before. On the evening that Sidious learned of his dark successes to cloning and election to Chancellor, he defeated his master, but Plegueis deftly placed his essence in the timeless shell of a seemingly harmless droid at the moment of his death. While Sidous and others could marry machine and flesh to preserve life through the Force, they could not do as Plegueis the Wise did and completely transition away from flesh without any loss of the Force. This is somewhat similar to the Jedi's ability transition to a Force Ghost but rather a Dark Force Possession. 

But let's look at how a Sith Master in the shell of a droid acts. Mostly, R2 appears to be harmlessly getting others into trouble but this is part of his evil ruse which cast shadow and doubt over his true nature. For example,   


* By befriending a protocol droid, he ensured that he could more easily spy and influence others.
* R2 copilots with a young, untrained pilot and fledgling force sensitive in his first battle who survives multiple dogfights and manages to make an impossible run on the Death Star trench and makes an incredible once-in-a-lifetime shot while turbo blasters, a Sith Master with years of piloting experience and two expert wing men have him in their sights.
* R2 could have shutdown all of the trash compactors on the Death Star immediately (something a highly logical AstroMech might offer to do) but enjoyed terrorizing everyone for a moment first while ""struggling"" to locate and stop the correct compactor.
* R2 repeats this last minute behavior again and again ""fixing"" the hyperdrive, opening/closing doors,  etc.
* We see that R2 has many capabilities (flight) in the earlier films but doesn't use them later so as not to draw attention.
* R2 lies about his previous master perhaps, ""I don't seem to remember ever owning a droid."" 
* How does an AstroMech droid, designed for repair of starships, be present in mostly senatorial duties and later possess such expertise as to be capable of cracking and manipulating Imperial systems? 

His motive since his undoing? Revenge is the recurring them in SWU.  He has been aiding the Rebellion this entire time. He's been manipulating and toying with everyone from the moment we are introduced to him. His objective is to bring disorder, chaos and death to the galaxy like the true Sith he is while simultaneously undoing the plans of his treacherous pupil and those that support him.

Darth R2D2 ultimately succeeded by aiding the One into existence, sheltering and ultimately killing entire the Skywalker family, killing the usurper, Darth Sidious and destroying his Empire (in effect twice), and eliminating both the Jedi & their Council, and the Sith on Exogal.

My idea was that after he kills Darth Maul, he discovers Quira (from Solo), who had been enslaved in the servitude of Maul, and finds herself charmed by Kenobi but still, indebted to The Syndicate, there's no way to have a lasting relationship, so they decide to have a child and she would keep his child safe in her care and would likely go unnoticed by the empire. 
There's all kinds of ways this story line could be developed or perhaps you could think of another way to work in Obi-Wan having a child of his own to protect the prophecy of a chosen one, thus enabling yet another Jedi character into the already convoluted storyline.

Looking for the cure, they get stranded on the planet of Iego with no way to leave due to the ‘Ghost of Drol’, a separatist defense system that prevents anyone from leaving the planet. Here they meet Jaybo Hood, a smart 10 year old kid who managed to reprogram hundreds of battle droids to be non-lethal and serve him instead. Later in the episode, Jaybo helps Anakin and Obi-Wan destroy the Ghost of Drol using a couple of vulture droids after which Anakin tells Jaybo “Now you’re free to go anywhere you want.” - Skip to Jedi: Survivor - With the collector’s edition, you get a steel cover with a cool cover that includes things that are important to the story. On the front you can very clearly see a bursted planet in the sky and on the back you can see a logo in the sky just above an old trade federation center, this logo also shows up later in the trailer when Cal is swinging using his grappling hook on one of the walls. This logo looks nearly identical to the symbol of the Nihils in the high republic, who’s also from the high republic? The jedi who was trapped in a bacta tank played by Cody Fern, who we can see later also joins the Nihils as he’s sitting next to one of the members of the faction. How do Jaybo Hood and the Nihils tie together? The bursted planet that shows up on the steel cover and the poster. There’s an interesting theory that the bursted planet is Iego, if you look at one of the moons that orbits Iego called Clepresdan it looks almost identical to the planet in the trailer. The separatists controlled Iego and its moons so that explains why both planets have so many battle droids left over. Jaybo might have had to flee Iego after it started to burst and got caught up with the Nihils on Clepresdan and made him work for them to reprogram the droids.

216,1670829937.0,StarWarsTheories,"Grogu origin revealed in new Tales of the Jedi miniseries? - First time posting, haven't seen anything with this theory yet and wanted to throw it out there. Be gentle, this is my first formed theory I'm throwing out there and not juet telling it drunkenly to any of my friends who'll humor me.

What if we were just told in the new miniseries what Grogu's origin is? We know now that Yaddle was taken (never showed as killed) by Palpatine and Count Dooku while the clone army was being created. In the same vein that we see one off, exact clones being made (like Boba was for Jango), perhaps Grogus origin is as a clone of Yaddle.

Before The Mandalorian we had never seen another of Yodas species, until The Child (later Grogu) was introduced. When the introduction occured, it was with a heavy connection to the Kaminoan cloning lab via the symbols on the scientists uniform. Seemingly the scientist was already familiar with The Child and might lead to there being a strong history or at least familiarity with his species. 

We know Yoda escaped order 66 and was staying on Degobah, but Yaddle was taken well before it happened and would have likely been kept imprisoned, sedated or otherwise on Kamino and would have been an exception to being killed under order 66. 

Ultimately, this would lead me to believe that Grogu could be a direct clone of Yaddle and not Yoda, or any other of their species."

218,1670449415.0,StarWarsTheories,"Force Ghosts are δαίμων and more frequent than we see - The Greeks had an idea that there were such things as δαίμων that could have been anything from Guardian Spirits to actual deities. It is unclear how these δαίμων came into being but it may be that there were fallen souls of the from the Golden Age. 

This could easily translate to what we see as Force Ghosts and why them seem to why they appear in the form or presence of someone dear to the individual. Luke didn’t have Reven, Kreia, or other great Jedi appear to him. It was Old Ben, Anakin, or Yoda that appeared to him. 

The same is true with Yoda. It was Qui-Gon that appeared to him and Old Ben. 

These Force Ghosts were most likely much more common than those that we see though. Rey, Ben Solo, Han, and others most likely had them—we just don’t see them in a visible form. They would guide and protect everyone in an unseen manner. 

Much as with those in Greek Lore, they are rarely seen and often just felt or presumed to be there. So when Han or other “Non-force Sensitive” has a bad feeling about something… it is just their force ghost guiding them or preparing them for something that is happening. 

The gift of the Force Priestesses was teaching a few how to be more easily seen or heard in a way that was more than just a feeling or feeling of a presence.

222,1667939400.0,StarWarsTheories,"Theory: Yaddle, Yoda and Grogu species is... -  

My theory: Yoda, Yaddle and Grogu are original Mandalorian race, their planet Mandalore was conquered millenia years ago by first Humans who came from The Core (it might be shown on wall paintings inside Beskar mines in The Mandalorian Season 3).

How this happened?

Colonists met Force sensitive race called Mandalorians with whom they shared planet on which they settled on. Few years after humans settled down, they discovered that Mandalorians are planning to use them as slaves to mine mineral known as Beskar.

So humanity rebelled, colonists made weapons against Force users. War took hundreds of years and devastated entire Sectors.

By having no other choice humans detonated huge bombs that sucked life from the planet, creating wasteland. Remaining Mandalorians escaped from planet into the hidden colonies.

Shamed of defeat they renounced name of their race.

So humans took that name and planet for themselves. They also were prepaing an art of fight against force user so they could defend themselves if Real Mandalorians return. Instead Jedi came to the planet with peace offering from Old Republic.

They were massacred. And knowing that Force users are still there Human Mandalorians went to Crusade to kill every one of the Jedi."
223,1667597677.0,StarWarsTheories,"(Andor) Update for previous theory after Ep. 9 - Hello! Back again since some people seemed to enjoy my lengthy (and a little messy) post. For those of you who didn’t read it, it detailed the most likely events if a prison break was to happen in episode 9.

As anyone who watched episode 9 might have noticed, there was no prison break in episode 9.

Puts a bit of a stopper on that theory, but oh well. I’d like to say that I had a good feeling there wouldn’t be a prison break, but no such thought of mine has been written down and shared with anyone, and I did take the time to write out a theory on how a prison break would happen, so I can claim no credit on that thought. Congratulations to the people who read the set-up and figured that out!

Now, this post is going to be discussing the things from the previous post that are more — or less — possible, as well as bits of information we now know that we didn’t before. With this, I will put together the most realistic move going forward.

So, starting this out, there are a few things that I want to address from my previous post.

1. The Sacrifice
2. The Floor Manager
3. Andor’s motivation
4. The Communicator
5. Panels

So first, The Sacrifice. He did die in the last episode. It was hinted that he couldn’t keep up in episode 8, and he did fall in episode 9. He died of a stroke, something that can happen when you are older and overwork yourself. His death created a change in the prison dynamic, to be discussed later, and leaves an opening in two ways. First, there will be a new prisoner. Second, the elevator will be used again.

Next, the Floor Manager. This person is now solidly in the pocket of the Escape Team. As a person with power, he can use it to push his people to execute an escape plan. As an individual, he cares for his people. He wanted them to lay low and get out. Now that is not an option. With this change in dynamic, we can expect him to keep his hard exterior but work behind the scenes to get his people out. I do not see him leaving the prison alive. If he does, however, I would consider myself pleasantly surprised.

Andor’s motivation? Turns out he’s already got plenty. He’s been working on a plan to get them out already — taking steps towards it anyway. He’s coordinating with other individuals in the room, sabotaging equipment, and watching carefully for any changing elements. Besides that, because of The Sacrifice’s incident, he’s now got an excellent reason to get out of the prison.

The Communicator. This man is not a part of any rebel movement; He is part of the prison news network (Turn on your TVs after work hours and tune in to PNN! The best place to get all your prison news!) and communicates with the other floors.

Lastly, the Panels. Turns out the communication panel wasn’t the only interesting panel around here. Various maintenance panels throughout the room can influence the lift — and possibly other things. This means that if one of the chords or things can be cut through, the lift can be stopped halfway down, which — according to Andor — is enough to get from the floor to the door where the prison guards are. This is the best tool to get from the floor to the upper room.

Now, along with these updates to old bits of information, we have some new things to talk about:

* Level 2 incident
* Lights out
* Confirmation of the lift

The Level two incident has significant implications but is actually very beneficial for anyone attempting to stage a prison break. From what was shared, this prison does not release prisoners; it simply shuffles them from one place to another once their number runs out. Either that, or they very briefly release the prisoner, rapidly arrest them for something small, mark up the sentence, and send them back into prison.

Either way, no prisoner actually leaves the prison. The numbers are, as Melchie claimed: a fabrication that allows the prisoners to stay there for as long as the Empire requires their manpower.

The level two incident itself is when all of the prisoners on level two realized this and tried to get the information to the other rooms. In the process, all of them were killed as the wardens learned of their discovery and turned on the floor.

Now, for the lights out thing. This is heavily related to the level two incident, as when the PNN attempted to convey the details of the discovery by level two, lights went off, and everything powered down. Sd the lights and everything returned, the news about level two became even more urgent from the PNN.

Noting the events of the Level 2 incident in coordination with the timing of the information, there are two possibilities, depending on how fast the PNN works. Firstly, the power went down because an enormous energy draw was required to electrocute the floors of all the people on level two. Second, the power down was unrelated and indicative of a malfunction.

The first one seems much more likely, unless it takes so long to get word through the PNN that the incident happened several weeks ago.

Lastly, the lift confirmation. Prison guards were lazy this time. When they added in a new prisoner, they didn’t wear their fancy shoes, and the prisoner got shocked by the rod held by the guard, not by the railing. The lift can not be electrified. It gets a nice little ‘Safe For Rioters’ stamp on it. In this it is added that *anything that moves* can’t be electrified.

I’ll bet using moving things will be useful at some point.

Now, back to theorizing an escape route!

Much of the details regarding the facility remain the same from what was last discussed, though now we have at least one specific number. While there are seven floors, seven rooms on each floor, seven tables per room, and seven people per table (49 prisoners per room, possibly fifty if you count the floor manager, meaning a max of 350 people per floor), there are only 12 guards — max — per floor. A good reason to be nervous about moving a new prisoner into a room is being outnumbered almost 30 to 1.

This means that the guards do not stand a chance if the floors fail, even with blasters.

Even twelve people against a room of prisoners would be hard on the guards, especially if the prisoners got close range fast.

The usual difficulty with this is that you must convince all the prisoners in the room that escape is the best option for them, even when it risks death. Thankfully, the Level 2 incident takes care of that real fast.

“Hey man, want to escape?”

“Nah man, I just have a few more days on my sentence. I don’t want to risk it.”

“But, man, they don’t actually let you go. They just send you to another workstation and get you working again.”

“...”

“So, man, you can either escape, die trying to escape, or die of overworking in a few years when they never let you go.”

“...Oh. You know what? I think I want to escape.”

“Great man! Come on, we’ve got this plan over here…”

You get the idea.

Besides spreading the information about level two to individuals on your floor, you can also spread that information through PNN to *all the other floors*. If you wanted a prison-wide riot? This is the way to get it.

Besides that, there is something new to take advantage of. There is a good chance that the energy draw needed to set an entire floor to a lethal level is too much for the prison’s power grid and will cause the power to shut down for a short time or shut off completely. This possibility can be taken from the detail on how the power suddenly went out when the PNN was working on delivering information about level 2.

Back to the original escape plan laid out, the steps for it are still widely applicable, if not more so, with the added information from episode 10. Once a prisoner is dropped off, stop the lift halfway and take out the guards. Make sure the door is stuck open, possibly using wires cut off to the side. Take the chamber, take weapons from the guards, and get shoes to fight them on even footing in the halls. At this point, the escapees can release prisoners from other levels to cause chaos, possibly overloading/cutting power so that electrifying the floor is no longer an option, making it so that more prisoners can act effectively. Once at the surface, prisoners can abduct whatever ships are on base and hit hyperspace.

But this plan still has problems. Firstly, twelve guards per floor can easily mean twelve pairs of boots per floor. Forty-nine people scrambling for twelve pairs of boots is chaos you do not want and might not be able to control. Two, you can use a uniform swap or a full-scale prison riot, but you have to be very careful using both. If a bunch of prisoners break out with no way to differentiate you from any other Imp, they will attack you. Three, there is still no information on any ships or other definite routes off the prison ship. Fourth, this is assuming that the electric floor is the only major defense system in a prison that is half set underwater.

If the Empire completely loses control of a station, I wouldn’t put it above them to sink the whole facility, Empire workers and all.

The image that Andor is painting for us is still missing pieces.

But the highest command prisoner in the room is on their side now. First step for Andor in the next episode is to grill the Floor Master on everything he knows about the prison and all the possible escape routes and defenses he knows about. That could be very little; that could be a lot. Either way, with him, you can organize the room, modify the current plan based on the provided information, and then execute their escape plan.

My biggest concern is timing.

For this plan to be set in motion, everyone needs to be in the workroom, and the lift needs to be halfway down. The only two times we know for sure this happens are when a new prison is brought down to the floor or when a doctor is called. There will be a prisoner added in the next few days — if not the very next day — since The Sacrifice died. But I do not know when the next opening will be — when the next person will die.

Does this mean that there will be an escape next episode?

I don’t know.

Andor needs time to work on the cables, cutting them out. There must be time to communicate with the other floors if they want to spread the upsetting news. There must be time to put together the specific roles necessary to escape the chamber and possibly time to practice, though the possibility of rehearsal is pretty low.

One of their possible openings is in the next episode, but that does not mean they jump for it.

This being Andor, once the action starts — and the escape plan begins — I expect most, if not all, of the individuals involved in this escape to die. That’s the tone this show has established, and I do not believe it is getting any lighter as it approaches its finale.

Despite all of this, there is an interesting possibility that this prison break ends up much larger than I am currently projecting. That would seem most possible to me if the factory place they are on has the capability to double as a Starship (which, in itself, doesn’t seem very possible).

The thing is, if there is a major prison break covering all the floors, then these people need to have a plan to get out a couple thousand people. Doing the math, if killing one room of people killed 100 people, and there are seven rooms per floor and seven floors in the facility, then that is 4,900 people. The chances of the prison having enough transports to help that many people out is slim to none since there is no practical reason for that to happen. No food delivery, personnel transfer, or prisoner delivery will involve a ship that can hold that many people. Besides, It would be smart to keep that level of transportation away from the prison just in case the prisoners manage a mass escape.

So, next episode will be one of two things, a planning and escape episode or just a set-up episode. As mentioned, there are still plenty of holes in the current plan that has been pieced together and Andor can always take more time to put a solid plan together. On the other hand, Andor could most certainly go through a quick planning and set-up episode in the crew quarters that then leads to action the next day.

The one thing that I think should happen before any of this goes down is the establishment of some way off of the prison. This can be Andor using knowledge of Empire prisons to put together where an exit should be or someone else mentioning a ship they can use. Maybe, if they are feeling really vicious, they can torture/threaten a guard to get information on a route out.

Anyway, since some people enjoyed my thoughts and pieced together bits last time, I thought I’d throw this together. Best of luck to all you theorists out there! This has been fun!

Tl; Dr - General escape plan from last post stays about the same, though some pieces stayed the same. Also, now the floor guy is on their side, which makes things easier to plan and execute. There is an opening for them to try to escape next episode, but they might just ignore that and wait for someone else to die."
224,1667001320.0,StarWarsTheories,"(ANDOR) Lengthy Theory on What Will Happen if There is a Prison Break in Episode 9 - This is assuming that there is no help from the outside. NO ONE seems to know who Andor is or what he is doing there. He is there under a fake name, and no one there seems to know anything.

Here is what we don’t know:

* Who is the new prisoner?
* What is the status of Hand Signal Man’s coordination? Is there any?
* If there is a chance/plan to escape, where would the room manager stand?

But here is the thing about any good show. They will give you the essentials where and when you need it. There will (probably) be a prison break episode. Following the formula of the past two arks, it will be the next episode.

That leaves us with a limited amount of resources to get things done, and most of the important parts of the facility will have already been revealed in episode 8. Would I like more? Yes. Would I like for things to have happened differently? Yes. Do I have a good idea of where things will be going? Well, I’m a writer, a story creator, and after you watch so many stories, consume so many stories, you see patterns. For sure? No. Possibilities? Yes.

The prison break is an event that will happen in isolation to everything else. If I’m reading this right, all the other events in Andor are leading towards a final event on Ferrix where Empire might, and backstabbing, will match against the Rebels. The adopted mother of Cassian will, likely, die in that ark and there will be a series of flashback scenes scattered throughout that ark to give closure to her and Cassian's storyline, landing Cassian firmly in the rebellion.

That’s my prediction given the pieces that have been presented to us and the current timing of everything.

Now! When it comes down to the prison break itself, this is Cassian pulling together a group and getting people who will be with him in his endeavors even after the prison break ends. This is something I say because that *must* be the case with the prisoner  Melshi who shows up in Rogue One to work with Cassian.

So let’s start with the Crew

* Cassian: This is the one who knows how to infiltrate, watch, and learn. He’s clocked what is at the top of the room. He knows about the boots, the stressed guards, the skeleton crew that maintains the upper area. He knows that if someone gets upstairs and gets the boots on, then that crew of guards is going to have a hard time getting their shit together. He knows that getting there is the problem.
* The Sacrifice: This is the old man. Chances of him getting out of this prison is slim. Chances of him dying because of an outburst or just because he overworks himself are high. He’s not got the strength of any of the others, but if something happens to him, eliciting a response from the Empire up stairs, that can make an opening.
* The Coordinator: This is hand signals man. Pardon me for being terrible with names. This is the one from Andor’s crew that was making hand signs with one of the other people in one of the other rooms. This guy is the key to organizing anything that takes people from more than one group to do and teaching others how to do the same. Though that is unlikely as long as someone people can’t trust (the room manager) exists
* The Philosopher: This is  Melshi . His words are sparks that can ignite flames because he believes so much in them himself, if nothing else. He has a spirit that would push him to do just about anything.
* The Anger: This guy is that guy who gives Andor a ‘what are you looking at’ kind of look before they all head to bed on the first day. He is fed up with this whole place. Someone wants him to punch a guard? He’d probably do it. Someone get on his bad side? He might punch them. All the same, he’s not a bad guy, he seems to have some sympathy for the old guy. My bet would be that if someone starts something with the old guy, or something happens to him, then he might get pushed a little further over the edge. This guy is a guy who doesn’t need  Melshi's words to act. He’s already ready to go.
* The Calm: This is the big man, pseudo head of the table. He’s the guy who introduces Andor to the crew. He gets along alright and seems to be hopeful, at least. He’s oddly chill about getting shocked, and offers up hope to any weary soul. I’ll be interested to see how this character reacts to the possible prison break. I don’t know if he’d join it and get out, but he might help the other people get out.
* That other guy: This guy didn’t really do anything, but he’s the last person on the group of seven so here he is! Probably will die.

Escaping the Prison.

I’m going to be working backwards through this. If you are in a cell and are looking out it can be difficult so we are going to start with the way to get out and work backwards. So we’ll start with the entrance…

Here is the fun thing. While each prison is made to keep prisoners in, no prison is made to be an airtight facility (figuratively speaking). There are things that need to come in and out of the facility on a day to day basis, or less frequently, in some cases. To list the ones that come to mind, we have:

1. Prisoner transportation
2. Resource transportation
3. Troop transportation
4. Shipments
5. Waste

Prisoners are required for this facility to run, and we’ve seen how they get these prisoners in and out. Next is the food and water and other equipment required to maintain the people and facilities. Then is the manpower required to keep things running as needed. You can’t rely for the prisoners to self manage everything, after all. All of these prisoners produce products which must be sent out to another facility to actually become something. And, at a minimum, all of these people produce waste that needs to be disposed of.

Prisoners are brought in by ship, as we have already seen. Given the whirlpools around the facility, any boat transport is unlikely in general as its hard to get something like that anywhere near the walls. That means that resources, shipments, and troops are all likely to be moved by ships, cargo or transport. For these, there will be a schedule, one that few, if any, of the prisoners are likely to be aware of.

Waste, however, is a slightly different matter. This is the Empire we are talking about here, an Empire that has to get rid of the bodies of Fried prisoners. The chances of them using a transport to actually move these people around is slim to none. There are three possibilities that I can see; one is doing trash compacting and sending it away through a shoot, one is burning it, and one is dumping everything, possibly into the water around the base.

Prisoners have to utilize one of these methods to leave. Waste seems the most tempting, but there is a high chance of getting killed while going through that process and an even slimmer chance of getting to a vehicle that has a hyperdrive to get off the planet afterwards.

Not to say that it is out of the picture.

For any of the scheduled flying options? You’d have to know the timings before you begin the escape, because once you do you are on a timer. Not a timer against the people in the facility, they are low on people, after all. You are on a timer against reinforcements coming down to reestablish control. And if word gets out that something is going down, any prisoner ships, transports, or cargo vehicles, are going to get called off or pushed back. Unless it's bringing reinforcements.

It’s an easy plot device to have someone show up who got their hands on some of the information. If they escape next episode, some knowledge of a ship, or other exit that eventually leads to a ship, is required.

We’ve got an exit (more or less) so now let’s get on to the next biggest defense.

The floor.

This is a floor that can be electrified, enough to kill someone, if necessary, though it's usually used to punish and immobilize. The only way to move over the electrified floor is with insulated footwear. Now, not everywhere has these floors. The beds that the prisoners use are likely lacking this feature, as well other locations where the prisoners aren’t meant to be at. You can’t where shoes all the time without risk of some infectious disease, so chances are there is a safe location for the guards to stay at as well.

Of course, with the amount of focus that has been put on these boots and the boots rack, it’s pretty clear that these boots are going to be used for the escape. And, while I do not have any actual evidence that this will happen, there is a very good chance that this floor is going to be turned into a weapon against the Empire. An audience appreciates Karma, and show runners know this.

But this still means that Andor and his crew will need to get these shoes, and something to defend themselves, while navigating the corridors. Leaving two optional:

1. Take the boots off the guards
2. Take the boots off the rack

While these goals seem separate, realistically there is only one way that this happens. Andor and his crew get access to the lift out of the work room and get into the room above it. In that room is the short staffed guards with their guns, shock baton, and so on. Knowing Andor’s combat ability, I would say that all this is one nice action scene away. And possibly a few accidents, if the show runners want to keep the thrilling feel they’ve kept going.

There are only three known reasons why this lift would be operated:

1. Removing a body
2. Replacing a worker
3. Worker riot

At this point the body removal has, probably, already happened. As an electric current passes through humans, I’m curious as to the specifics of the method, since they can’t simply keep the floors hot all the time if the Empire and the workers are in the same room while a body is being removed.

As a worker died in the last episode, there will be a new worker coming down at some point during the workday. Either then, or when the old man dies someone will replace him on Andor’s crew.

A worker riot? Well, it would have to be a smart one. The floors can be electrified, rendering a regular brawl unlikely. The tables make things interesting. People up top can electrify the floors, but if someone jumps up on the tables, who is going to get them down? Best you can do is to open the door and have Empire people on the elevator. And we aren’t sure if the electrification applies to the balcony and railing.

Also, let me draw another blank amongst all this planning, leaving more room for the unknown. We do not know what the communication panel the floor commander went to does. That could provide more interesting possibilities.

So, the most ideal escape from this prison? Coordinate riots over a series of rooms at the same time. Stretch the Empire’s forces thin. Use the tables to avoid the inevitable shock, avoid contact with anyone reaching for you to avoid them dragging you down. Once the doors open up and guards come down, speed is your best friend. You need to get on the balcony (assuming that its not electrified) and take out the person on the control panels to keep the doors open. Get the officer's boots, then use the boot rack to get more uniforms to more people. Dress up in their uniforms and take the guards weapons. Chances are slim any guard in this situation would take the time to count how many prisoners are in each room. With the disguises on, find and take over one of the transports on the base to get out. With Empire codes on the vehicle, hopefully it will buy enough time to jet off.

This is only possible by getting Melshi to rile up the people with his words and theories, getting other people as mad as The Anger.

But, really? This plan relies on a lot of luck.

I’d bet that there is some extra piece that has not been introduced yet that acts as the catalyst, or trigger, for this escape. You want to hear something a little weird?

Andor isn’t setting up an escape.

There is a status quo in the prison, one that is kept through the entire episode. There are too many hostile people on the grounds of the prison, or possible hostiles. Anyone given a solid option to escape would have taken it already. Especially Anger and  Melshi. They haven’t had any, and Andor’s info is enough to take advantage of an opening, but not enough to act in the uncertain stasis of prison life.

So now we’re off to the next fun thing.

What’s the trigger?

Short answer? We don’t know.

Long answer? Well… let’s buckle down for some more *speculation*.

Firstly, let’s get the least likely out of the way. Fun fact, During the same year as Andor, 5 BBY, the Star Wars Rebels show began. In Rebels Ezra used a massive Empire radio to broadcast a message that is known to have sparked more rebellion in the world, and even inspired his parents to stage an escape from their prison. However, from my own observations, Rebels happens a while after Aldani as the team in Rebels acted as a rebel cell supported by a greater organized framework in the region.

Would it be cool if Ezra’s message caused a riot that helped Andor escape? Yes. Is that likely? I do not think so.

Now, we’ve got three other possible scenarios that I can think of:

1. Added prisoner Recognizes Andor or Adds something
2. There is an event/accident that takes the prison
3. A group already planning a prison break hits the prison

First one, of course, is the most gripping. If it's someone off Ferrix that adds tension between him and everyone else who knew Andor as his fake identity. Next, they can bring Andor news about how people are trying to find him because of his adopted mother’s ill health. If there was anything to put a fire under him, it would be that. Preferably there would also be some kind of other information, but from there Andor could start putting together his plan to make an opening. From what we saw of the last episode? This person could very well be that shopkeeper that got caught by Dedra Meero.

For the second one? This is a boatload of possibilities wrapped up under one banner. This is the arrival of an inspector that sets something off. This is Sacrifice’s untimely death. This is a mechanical accident that results in death. This is the failure of a security system that leaves an opening. This is what a writer can use if they don’t have any other option that appeals to them. Does that mean it would be bad? No. A slowly drowning facility, especially, would be a terror to escape from. But this isn’t something that we’ve necessarily seen coming in episode 8, which means to me it's less likely than the others.

The last one assumes that Mr. Communicator was communicating for more reason than just catching up with a friend. It’s quite possible that Mr. Communicator and his prison friend are part of a bigger event that is coming to the prison. If they unleash hell, Andor is not the kind of person to miss that opportunity.

As I said, the first of these options (not the rebels one) seems the most catching, but that doesn’t mean it will happen.

Anyway! That’s my fun little attempt at laying out the events of Andor Episode 9. We’ll see how close I get I guess.

(Tldr: Working from the last episode, I theorize that it is most likely that someone from Ferrix shows up and pushes Andor to escape using the pieces he has found in episode 8)

225,1666926222.0,StarWarsTheories,"(Andor) Bix is the Leader from Kenari. - New here so not sure if this has been mentioned before, but I have a theory that the ""Unnamed Alpha Leader"" from Kenari is Bix. Wookieepedia says that the Alpha Leader died on Kenai, but was that confirmed? She was shot, but dragged out by the party and we never see what happens to her. Andor, Bix and Brasso all seem way closer than close friends. They act more like family members, with Bix acting more like a concerned/protective/frustrated big sister than a friend, and Cassian doesn't seem to be the type of person to make or trust friends. I think the closeness of the 3 point back to their growing up together on Kenari. This would also explain Cassian saying to Timm ""I wouldn't worry. She's tougher than both of us"". I mean, why would Bix tell Timm that Cassian was from Kenari? She's far too protective of Cassian to out his secrets like that, unless she was telling Timm her own story about Kenari, and mentioned Cassian, maybe to explain why they are so close. 
Also Bix and Brasso are very protective of Marvva. I suspect Marrva went back to Kenari and rescued some of the Kenari kids, and they were subsequently adopted by other families (it's written that the salvage yard Bix works in was owned by her ""parents""). As for Cassian's sister, his persistence to find her indicates that he is convinced she made it off Kenari somehow. Maybe human trafficers or slave traders were rounding up kids, and Marvva could not save them all, and Kerri was separated from the group somehow (or Maarva could only save the 3, IDK). 

I suspect that during the interrogation of Bix, we might learn more about the Kenari Kids, and how Cassian, Bix, Brasso and Marvva are all tied to Kenari.

(Alternate timeline discussion) - From what I understand about the comics, Palpatine was cloned. Regarding the newest film in the sequels, we were told by an outside source rather than directly from the film that Palpatine was cloned. However, before I learned any of this, I wondered why Palpatine was alive.

In response to this confusion, I decided to watch the part of Return of The Jedi where Palpatine dies, just to make sure there's no chances of Palpatine teleporting out of the scene last minute. Upon my first watch, it was clear that Palpatine fell into the reactor, however, I did not give up from there. Instead, I zoomed in on YouTube 200% or so, made sure the video quality was the highest it could be, and used "" . "" and "" , "" to watch the video frame by frame.

Through these factors, I noted these details:

\#1 Some time before Palpatine falls into the reactor, you see his limbs disappear.

\#2 Before Palpatine falls into the reactor, there's a bright flash of light.

\#3 Right at the end, it appears as though just Palpatine's robe is falling, considering his limbs mysteriously vanished, and it folded, as though there is only the robe left.

I put this with the ""Alternate Timeline,"" flair because I wouldn't think the writers of Star Wars expected people to watch his death scene frame by frame and could have done this simply to reduce detail with distance, but if this was somehow intentional, it appears Palpatine's body mysteriously vanished with some time to spare before what was left fell into the reactor. In this hypothetical alternate timeline, Palpatine teleported out last minute, faking his death, although visually, it's almost undeniable that he died."

But in the kenobi show ( 10 years after order 66) he lives in a cave and has failed to reach qui-gon until the very end. Has this been addressed? I know there is already talks of the new tales of the Jedi likely retconning the construction of Ashoka’s sabers from the novel.
228,1666121392.0,StarWarsTheories,"Palpatine's Genius: Making the Enemy Think They Won to Drop Their Guard - When we see the clone of Palpatine, Rey could have approached this clone at any age, but what happened was, this clone was old, even older than the characters we see that were from the Saga before the new episodes. With this in mind, the clone of Palpatine we see in Rise of Skywalker would have actually not have been created a few years upon Palpatine's death, but likely would have been around during Return of the Jedi, and potentially even before that. With that being said, Snoke would have also been around before Palpatine's death, too. If Snoke was a flawed clone of Palpatine, and the Rise of Sky Walker Palpatine was there long before his death, it implies that Palpatine already had an unknown amount of clones of himself that he was working with, each leading a different part of the Sith in some way.

As far as the protagonists knew, there was only one Palpatine, so once Palpatine was defeated, they thought that the threat of the Sith is over, at least a major threat. In the meantime, I feel as though the Starkiller base would have been around or at least worked on for hundreds of years, especially considering how fast the Empire could build Death Stars.  However, this project would have been much more different, i.e., it was large enough to encapsulate an entire Star, while the first working Death Star was smaller than Earth's moon. I don't feel as though they would have started working on it just as Palpatine died, considering its sheer scale. 

The genius of Palpatine convincing that the Empire that his plans have been permanently foiled comes in most to what a ""win"" for the Jedi would look like. If his forces hide away and build their project light years away without interaction, also blocking their respective star so that light can't bounce to where they couldn't be observed nor detected, it means that Jedi for a time don't have a reason to train strong in the force, neither would they have fights to grow stronger with, at least for a while. The Jedi would go home, back to the civilization where the Republic lives.

Strategically speaking, when the Star Killer base fired its weapon and destroyed those many planets which it did, Palpatine has already won. The Star Killer base did what it was meant to do all those hundreds of years without challenge, considering no one seemed to know about it. 

Although Rey might become a Jedi, there's actually no group called the ""Jedi,"" anymore. For there to be a ""Jedi temple,"" and an organized ranking system where people deem students worthy to be called ""Master.""  The exception with this, however, would be to assume that Force Ghosts can train people and give full mentorships to future Jedi students, but instead of such, there would only be people who use the force who just so happen to train in the same way Jedi would. There are, however, still ""Sith."" Although Rey is going in the general direction of the Jedi, there's no one left to actually re-establish the Jedi council with all the history, background knowledge, rules and discipline in order to properly train future generations.

As a result, despite the Starkiller base destroyed, there's an unknown number of Palpatine clones that could still be out there, while, by contrast, all the Jedi masters have died off, but even more death occurred when Palpatine shot force lightning into the air, destroying various ships. With the Republic destroyed, Palpatine has mostly won, with the exception of the last remaining Rebel forces."
229,1666116641.0,StarWarsTheories,"A Corruption Arc for Rey seems to be approaching, but we don't know when it will occur. - Rey (for the most part) hasn't had any mentors except Luke Skywalker and potentially Leah to guide her properly in the force. When she fights Kylo Ren, she clearly fought with rage, and given the opportunity, she likely would have killed Kylo Ren, even when he was on the floor injured. Regarding the incident with Chewbacca's escape, she ended up using force lightning out of anger. ""Force Healing,"" in the meantime, was actually talked about by Palpatine regarding Plageuis the wise. As a final point, when she fought the ""evil version of herself,"" she was clearly afraid.

When Luke fought the evil version of himself in Dagobah, when he finally killed what he thought to be Vader, it ended up revealing his own face under the mask, and he was shocked to see this. Symbolically, the evil version of Luke being unmasked to reveal himself shows that Luke indeed has darkness within him, but he didn't fully realize it. The evil version of Luke is what Luke could become if he gets corrupted by his impulses and the dark side.

If we compare this scene to that of Rey fighting the evil version of herself, the evil version of Rey doesn't have any type of mask to conceal herself, but instead makes eye-to-eye contact with Rey, almost as looking in a mirror. Furthermore, the Sith version of Rey says in a calming voice, ""Don't be afraid of who you are."" This version of Rey, by comparison, is what Rey is hiding. 

If you think about it, in the fight scene, the Sith version of Rey actually scares her out of the room to where she falls on her back, thereby ""winning,"" thus overpowering her mentally. However, Rey hasn't turned to the dark side completely, although having various qualities and ""red flags,"" that would point towards the notion that a corruption Arc is imminent. Rey is afraid of who she is, and her restraint to turn to the Dark Side has slipped in the past already. However, we don't know what it would actually take for Rey to ""completely lose herself,"" thereby giving in to the Dark Side."

232,1665471676.0,StarWarsTheories,"""A Long Time ago in a Galaxy far far away"" and why it's important and a Plethora for Future Storytelling - (As a disclaimer, this is my first attempt at attempting to theorize about Star Wars lore, and I'm being fully serious when I talk about this, with respect for the Star Wars franchise as a whole)

As of today, I thought about the notion of the first words that appear in Star Wars, i.e. the quote in the title. As a Sci-Fi, possibly uniquely to Star Wars for its time, this Sci-Fi occurred in the past, and potentially a distant past. If you were to cut out that section and replace it with Star Wars taking place in the future, the entire story can play out exactly the same, at least for the central plot of the story, but the notion that it takes place in the past adds for a potential layer of lore. The notion that Star Wars takes place in our past implies that events will ""play out"" into present-day time, where force-users don't exist on Earth. 

Furthermore, I've asked myself questions that would relate to the overall state of humanity in Star Wars, and I'll elaborate on their importance under the questions:

\#1 Are Han Solo and Obi-Wan, for the sake of simplicity, the same species as humans that live on Earth?

The actors of these characters, of course, are humans, but that isn't what this question addresses. In the lore or plot of Star Wars, are these characters really humans, or of a different species that are undistinguishable in appearance, personality, intelligence and social ques from humans? If these beings aren't actually human but coincidentally identical to human-kind, the question of why humans are both in the distant past and why they have technologies that are far beyond their era and speak English in various dialects such as American and British, simply because they aren't humans to begin with, but something else. On the contrary, if they are really the same species as humans from Earth, it's important to attempt to answer as to why humans are in the distant past, yet somehow have technologies that don't exist on Earth yet.

\#2 On present-day Earth (which is in the perspective of Star Wars's setting to be in the future), why are there no Jedi, nor force users for that matter?

On the basis Star Wars occurs in our past, societies have reached a point where they're populating various solar systems across their Galaxy. The Force appears to be something that can be used within the context of the Star Wars franchise, which takes in our past, yet humans don't possess access to this. Although Jedi are rare amongst the populace across societies in Star Wars, it can be seen as rather odd that, going throughout human history, there haven't been any people who have accidentally discovered the power of the Force, still being weak in the Force, being generous. Earth, in the meantime, would be a suitable place for Force-ghosts to inhabit, seeing that it's full of life. 

\#3 Despite Earth being in another Galaxy, present-day is part of the timeline, so how do things eventually lead up to now, and could it be the other way around?

Whether the events of Star-Wars have influence in or perhaps remain fully independent of modern-day Earth, because Star Wars takes place in the past, the over-arching timeline will eventually reach this point in time for humans that inhabit Earth. What could also be important is the idea that people in Star Wars tend to speak in the American and British dialects of English. With America being a young country and Star Wars occurring in the distant past, it's unconfirmed neither shown on film, but there could be the slight possibility of Time Travel, because the American dialect of English would have been rather modern, and the British and American dialects of speaking English could have originated from Earth and taken with the time-travelers when they went to explore other galaxies.

Using various models of thought, I could give out possible solutions for these various questions. 

Model #1: Time Travelers (Answers most questions)

Thus far, time travel has not been used nor hinted at in Star Wars. However, there are humans who speak in a modern language, and in various dialects of said language that originate from Earth, more specifically, from America and England. At least from what I know thus far, English is the only Earthly language that humans speak. It appears, then, that if a whole colony of humans were to not only travel to a non-neighboring distant galaxy, but also time travel, the original group of people seemed to agree that they allowed English to be their universal language so that the language barrier didn't need to be a problem with future cooperation. The final questions, then, would be as to why humans felt the need to travel far back in time in a massive colony, or perhaps colonies, and how they eventually gained access to the force while some humans don't have it. 

Model #2: Humanity didn't originate on Earth (a little more far-fetched)

If Han Solo, for example, is a human native to the galaxy in the setting of the Star Wars franchise without Time-Travel, it suggests that humans would eventually find Earth and colonize it. The unanswered questions, then, would be as to why humans didn't have their technology, knowledge of the other civilizations, access to the force, and why humans would somehow develop the same language the humans universally spoke in Star Wars, also somehow developing the exact same English dialects we end up seeing in Star Wars, too, despite not developing them until thousands of years later.

My best attempt at creating this model would be that people were sent to Earth and formed a pact in agreement to pretend to their descendants that they knew nothing about the advanced technologies and all the other important things that happen in Star Wars, and populated the Earth in such a way that they gave up their native languages and various life-saving practices in order for what would be Earth humans to learn to grow and advance on their own, but thousands of years later were lead by the Force ghosts who didn't expose their identity to help with the further advancement of human society until it was time for them to re-learn the English language, which humans might have thought were their own language. We would also have to assume that there was absolutely no force-users going far back in the lineage for all of the thousands of people in the colony to ensure there wouldn't be any Jedi nor Sith in the future civilizations.

Model #3: It's all a coincidence (Far leaps in logic)

In this model, Obi Wan isn't a human, but is a species of alien that is undistinguishable from humans that live on Earth aside from genetics and genetic compatibility, and also just so happens to speak the same language that would be developed on a planet that has never interacted with their kind. Humans on Earth have not developed the force, at least not yet but potentially still can. This model suggests that the Star Wars franchise and modern day exist on the same time-line, but neither has been important to the other, and both can exist independently, despite their uncanny levels of similarity that would have otherwise been seen as evidence that Earth was or either will eventually interact with the events of Star Wars.

Model #4: The people we see in Star Wars aren't human, nor are they ancestors of humans, but eventually guide humans. (assumes that Obi Wan isn't a human)

The human-like beings in Star Wars could theoretically blend in with Earth-native humans by guiding their culture and advancement without detection. Jedi mind-tricks would play a large role in this, as well as force-ghosts. The Jedi, then, could teach humans various things behind the scenes by using Jedi Mind-tricks to insert thoughts and ideas into human minds to help humans create inventions and create languages, which would eventually lead to English, which is the prominent language amongst Star Wars humanoids. The question that could arise would be as to why the Jedi would bother doing this, especially during the time humans are advanced. However, this is merely a model around how things could play out regarding how Star Wars relates to modern day on the overall timeline. 

Model #5: Humanity's connection to the force has been dying out, and the people who made it to Earth didn't speak English, but rather an alien language, but weren't experienced in teaching how to read and write, nor important survival techniques. 

This model suggests that the first language on Earth was from an alien language a group of humans decided to adopt and only speak. These humans, potentially crash-landing on Earth, didn't expect to stay on Earth, but when they had to, they didn't know what to do, neither did they know what to pass down except for the ability to sharpen rocks into weapons, make fire, as well as hunt and gather. Without this knowledge, we're rather limited, especially when we're inexperienced on how to pass the knowledge down to our potential offspring. Even if they had advanced technology, these technologies, especially damaged, would have broken down overtime until they become unrecognizable, which could have very-well happened due to rain and weather conditions buffeting the last remnants of technology this group of humans had. Multiple generations later, humans could have forgotten as to where they originated from. ""We came from the Stars,"" would have been their best remaining explanation once the details get heavily reduced down, but eventually this would fade into legend. The conspiracy theories about aliens helping humans to advance would actually be about the rest of the human race this group of humans lost contact with but are deciding to help this small faction of humans survive and eventually be re-introduced back into the rest of human society we have forgotten about.

&#x200B;

As for the present, these are my current models for how Star Wars could eventually lead to the present, and I fully acknowledge that they aren't perfect, but could be potential solutions for what could become of the Star Wars franchise."
233,1664578775.0,StarWarsTheories,"Anakin's Mental issues -    After thinking long and hard about it and revisiting some of the media back to back, it has become incredibly hard for me to really see Prequel Anakin and TCW Anakin as the same person, especially when Disney Canon pre OT Vader is added to the mix. Prequel Anakin to me seems like a lost cause from AOTC on, like he's just waiting to snap. Admittedly this seems more to be due to both chemical inbalances and outside circumstances but by the time he was an adult his fall seemed inevitable. He's also for the most part friendless and incredibly anti social, prefering to spend his time glowering and glaring than getting to know the people around him. By contrast TCW Anakin is clearly a troubled but outgoing good(ish) guy with some dark qualities which he tries to curb constantly, and has a decently large very close social circle around him that would sort of act as a dampener to his hatred of the world at large. This isn't to say that TCW Anakin was incapable of falling to the dark side, far from it, but if he did turn I'd see him becoming more like legends Dooku, OT and Legends Vader, or even Nu Canon Maul than the slasher-esque monster we get in Kenobi. On the other hand Prequel Anakin seems much more likely to become the vicious, rage fueled, world despising monster Disney gives us but seems rather unfitting for the calm, collected, and pragmatic Vader of Empire and ROTJ. 

A good example of this dichotomy is the infamous Tusken massacre scene in AOTC. In AOTC, Anakin slaughters the Tusken raiders, remains mad about it long afterwards and seemingly feels no remorse for his actions days later, with his only regret being that he wasn't strong enough to save his mother.While I could absolutely see TCW Anakin going on a rage fueled massacre especially after the death of his mother, the lack of remorse days later seems uncharacteristic and at no point does he express horror at his actions the ways he's done many a times in TCW. There's also his relation with Obi Wan, from the beginning it's clear that Obi Wan generally considers himself Anakin's friend and acts like it, save for berating him on shit that he still covers for him, but Anakin is always awkward and resentful towards Obi Wan. He's also much more submissive to Obi Wan later than he was in ROTS, or TCW, preferring to vent to others than argue with Kenobi. You could argue that this was just him being a powerless padawan, but an astute viewer will notice he's a lot less like this during the speeder chase where Obi Wan and Anakin are constantly shit talking each other and bantering. It is only when his mind drifts towards Padme that he starts to become resentful and submissive. Keep the Padme thing in mind because that's going to be very important later on. 

Even the way they express themselves is very different, from their body language to their emotional reactions. Prequel Anakin slouches while TCW Anakin swagger, Prequel Anakin is melodramatic whereas TCW Anakin is casual, Prequel Anakin screams in explosive fury while TCW Anakin prefers low growls and cold determination. Even their speaking voices are different, though as Hayden has shown us, still absolutely possible from the same set of vocal chords. 

I've actually struggled with this for a while until it suddenly hit me, Anakin has dissociative personality disorder but not in the way people tend to think. It's not that there's the saintly Anakin and the wicked Darth Vader, it's that inside his head there are two Anakin Skywalkers and later on, two Vaders. In real life, the personality of someone isn't fully integrated until around the age of ten which is why trauma experienced before ten can lead to extreme disassociation while trauma afterwards usually doesn't. It's safe to say that because Anakin seemed relatively stable during TPM (something bolstered by the fact that slavery on Tattooine is more Greek style than American Chattel, ie bad but not utterly horrifying) so the trauma that really pushed him over the edge would've been the death of Qui Gon, his separation from his mother, and the whole being shittalked by the council thing.

Because this was relatively late in the potential disassociation period and Anakin had a much more developed sense of self, it was less like a new personality was created and more along the lines of two divergent paths. A narcissistic, self pitying, infantile, and anti social Anakin driven by a desire to be loved and praised, and a more mature, empathetic, cocky, and social Anakin driven by a desire to care for and connect with others. For our purposes we'll call the former AnakinA and the latter AnakinB. AnakinB is what some psychologists would call a 'parent complex' a personality that takes hold when things get serious in life or death situations, while AnakinA is a 'child complex' who shows up much more when Anakin has the physical upper hand and is only in mental straits. If you want a simpler explanation think of the way some people can deal with a broken limb much better than they can with a papercut or mean comment. Keep in mind these aren't totally separate personalities, just very differing mindsets, both share the same memories and aren't exactly aware that there is discontinuity. 

The trigger for this change isn't anger, love, concern or jealousy but his *mommy issues* specifically the ones that tie into his relationship with Padme. It's clear from the TPM that there's some serious Freudian stuff going on between Anakin and Padme, that almost leads into substitute Oedipus level stuff. Cause if Qui Gon was the substitute father, than that really left Padme as the substitute mother (unless that was Jar Jar), one who like his true mother, was separated from him allowing him to idealize her more and more as a source of unconditional love, which is exactly what AnakinA wants. AnakinB by contrast doesn't really need that as much, and so for the most part the other side is in control when Padme comes up. More importantly, due to his incredibly subjective and egocentric worldview, AnakinA will do absolutely anything to get that praise and love, and will destroy anything that gets in his way towards getting it. If you want an example look at the ways that Anakin displays anger in TCW over Ashoka (his substitute daughter/little sister) and Padme (his substitute mother), especially when dealing with Clovis. If there was only AnakinB he'd probably just be a showy dick who'd constantly be trying to nonviolently emasculate and embarrass Clovis, but he immediately gets violent with very little provocation. Hell, most of TCW specifically takes place when Anakin is away from Padme doing Jedi stuff, while the prequels are when he's most focused on her. 

This also plays into his relation with Palpatine, the father who at first gives nothing but praise, and who AnakinA follows around like a puppy. AnakinB likes Palpatine, but is much closer with Obi Wan, the brother figure who doesn't shower him with unconditional praise but always has his back. In fact if AnakinB was in control during the sith reveal, he'd most likely try and kill or capture Palpatine on his own instead of running to Windu. But he wasn't, because not only was he being bombarded with Padme's death, but the people who anchored him to his B persona (Obi Wan, Rex, and Ashoka) were all off world. AnakinA can also very easily takeout all the Jedi including the kids because in his mind, they've always hated and him and are getting in the way of him possessing his ideal momwife.  And when Padme finally confronts him after he turns, she proves to not be the ideal archetypal maternal figure who always supports him, he tries to destroy her. By the time he's in the suit AnakinB is completely dormant and AnakinA now believes that the jedi order (who caused his rage which he doesn't feel accountable for) and the republic, if not the universe got rid of his chance at a momwife causing him to despise it. Both Anakin's are now Vader but AnakinA now VaderA is now a much worse Vader than the more resigned and cold VaderB. 

This would continue until  ANH, which has a screaming, shrill, petulant Vader with only a few glimpses of VaderB, but then something changes when we see him in empire. Vader is much colder, less submissive, less cruel and much more pragmatic, his rage now causing him to speak in an ominous monotone instead of a constant sneering roar. I think the reason for this is because one, the rebels are an actual threat instead of despised insects to be crushed, and two Luke is someone who Vader feels he has responsibility towards which, without Padme slowly drives him more towards VaderB. By the time of ROTJ he's almost back to his AnakinB persona being relatively regretful, sad, and much less violent than he was in empire. He can look at things rationally now, accept that there's no getting Padme back, and ultimately realizes just how miserable a life without friends or even positive acquaintances (something he thrives on) is.

In the end I ultimately realize this theory is bizarre and subjective but it at least makes sense to me in terms of Anakin, and later Vader's wildly inconsistent character."

When Rebels was still coming out, a lot of people wanted Ezra to fall to the dark side because of the Sith Holocron that he was tempted with. I saw some people disappointed when he didn't.

Now, Jon Favreau mentioned at the D23 expo, one of the cool parts of seeing the Ashoka show was seeing ""the lightsaber battles come to life"". 

I'm terrified that somehow Thrawn will be able to turn Ezra to the dark side and essentially use him as his own personal Vader.

And I'm also scared that either Ashoka, or even more scary, Sabine, who still has Ezra's lightsaber by the way, will have to fight, and possibly kill Ezra.

Some people assumed that when Ashoka said in the mandalorian, ""Where is Thrawn"" it was because neither of them had been found and so if you find one, you'd find the other.

Most of the episode stays the same, except of instead of blaming the Jedi for the destruction the Separatists caused Watt Kaa realizes that the Separatists are here for another reason.  Wag Too suggests fighting back but Watt Kaa objects stating that doing so would get them all killed. Instead, he decides that they would leave the village at night and head to another location until the Separtists left. He also sends a Lurmen Scout to spy on the Separtists and find out what they are up to.

When the colonists find out that they Separtists plan to test their new superweapon on them, Wagg Too again insists on fighting back and looking for the Jedi for help, but Watt Kaa shoots down both plans as too risky. He insists on sticking to the original plan, only instead of going to a remote location they will go to some caves where they have hidden their ship and leave Maridun before the Separtists realize they are gone.

By the time the heroes get back to the village to help the Lurmen, they find it to be deserted. They get back on the shuttle and eventually they find the Lurmen Colonists being ambushed by some of Maridun's fauna. They save them, and instead of being irate with them Watt Kaa is grateful that the Jedi came to their aid. However, he thinks that the Jedi's plan to take on the Separtists head on is fool-hardy and instead insists that the Jedi and Clones help them escape Mardiun. Anakin and the Clones are reluctant to commit to this, but after some persuasion from Ahsoka and Aalya Secura they decide to split up into two teams. Ahsoka and the clones would help the colonists escape on their old ship, while Anakin and Aalya would capture Lok Durd and destroy his weapon.

Both teams are successful in their objectives, and are about to flee Maridun only to find two Separtists cruisers blocking their escape. Ahsoka and Anakin, use their fancy flying skills to get past the cruisers at the expense of the discomfort of Lok Durd and Watt Kaa.

Finally, they rendevous with the Resolute and take Lok Durd into custody. Before they leave, Watt Kaa and the colonists thank the Jedi for coming to their aid, but Kaa still insists on finding a place where they can live out their lives in peace away from the Wars.

Being raised outside the Order traveling with a morally grey Mandalorian, he'll form a unique relationship with the Force that neither stigmatizes nor deifies the dark side. He'll come to understand that emotion and attachment are an inherent reality in all conscious life that shares a connection with the Force, and realize that the strict self-denying doctrine of the Jedi played a role in radicalizing the Sith.

This is the logical conclusion of the great struggle between the dark side and the light side, right? Anakin, Luke, and Rey all worked to bring balance to the force - Anakin representing a fall from light to dark, Luke representing a rise from dark to light, and Rey representing the beginning of the coexistence of both. Each ushering their predecessor into the next phase shortly before their death. The scales tip one way, then they tip the other way, then they even out - it's only natural.

Grogu, discovering most of what he will eventually know about the Force through his own study and experimentation, will have a deep appreciation for the natural state of the force. Imagine the landscape of the Force as a dense forest; While a Jedi can only navigate in the light patches for fear of being consumed by the dark, and Sith can only dwell in the shadows for fear of being weakened by the light, Grogu will have the freedom to walk through shadows and light alike, will fall victim to neither and make constructive use of both.

-----

For example, let's fill in the plot hole of Rey suddenly discovering Force healing, which would have let Anakin save Padme and prevent the formation of the Empire - it's likely a dark side ability, fueled by passion, sentiment, fear of loss and the desire to defy fate. Not something you can learn from a Jedi, and the perfect example of why the Jedi were wrong to fear the dark side in its entirety. Healers were often burned at the stake as witches by religious fanatics claiming to be champions of light.

It seems like dark side abilities come more naturally and easily than light side ones - Grogu choked a woman out before he could reliably catch a ball, and Rey's shot of lightning was a total accident. It makes sense, since the easiest emotions to feel are the strong ones that fuel the dark side.

Anakin was trained to deliberately cut off his connection to the dark side, that's why he never had the ability to heal Padme. The only way for him to connect to those feelings and abilities within the context of Jedi and Sith was through circumstances that made him miss the birth of his kids and fail to save her anyway. The tragedy isn't that Anakin fell to the dark side, the tragedy is that he was in a binary system (no Tattooine pun intended) that forced him to choose between the *ability* to save his wife, and the *opportunity* to do so.

It's also possible that a passive connection to the dark side was Rey's shortcut to developing such a deep connection with the Force so quickly - after all, don't you learn faster when you're sparked by passion? She wasn't trained to keep the dark side out, she wasn't taught to deny the light - it's all just the Force to her, she lets it all flow through her equally, resulting in a faster flow overall.

The Jedi saw this expedited growth as greedy, power-hungry - but, with a mind fortified against the allure of being completely consumed by the dark, you can use that power to simply deepen your connection with the Force faster. It's natural, it's okay.

Rey has a lot of potential to be the next Anakin - an excellent idea of a character whose first movies had mixed reception, but a symbol that could come to represent a central theme in the new Star Wars saga: true balance.

-----

As for the conflict - maybe an extremist order of light side users would really shake things up, drive home the point that light isn't inherently good just as dark isn't inherently evil. Highlight the flaws of the Jedi Order by exaggerating them in this oppressive new Grand Order of Jedi that thinks itself a cleansing fire against the heretical ways of Grogu and his Magi, who they see as pagan self-worshipers who seek to consume light and dark alike. The Magi's fascination and study of the Night Sisters' unique connection to the force certainly contributes to that pagan image.

------

S2g, when I had this idea it clicked so hard with my own personal spiritual journey. I really want to be the one to write this story some day. If you're a graphic novelist who loves the idea, maybe hit me up and we can throw together something to pitch to Disney?

Think about it, man. Grand Magus Grogu, close friend of the Djarin dynasty of Mandalore, wielder of both a white saber of Beskar and a dark saber of Electrum (not to be confused with the Saber of Mandalore, *the* Dark Saber), the third, final, and immortal Yodathing (species name pending).

-----

Which, come to think of it, has wild implications. If the third Yoda is all about balance, and the last Yoda was all about light, then was there a Yoda before him that was all about the dark side?

Who exactly was Yaddle, anyway? I'm thinking it's possible she was a dark side witch living in a certain hut on Dagobah when a young Yoda met her there. Their ideologies clashed, but they shared a deep respect for the Force and the natural world, and had deep spiritual conversations often. They fell in love - a being of darkness accepting some glow, and a being of light accepting some shade. She finally agreed to come to the temple and learn the ways of the Jedi.

Over the centuries, their scandalous romance simmered into a deep friendship. Idk how Yodathings mate, but we know conception through the force is possible so mating might not be a sexual or even romantic thing for them. When Grogu was born, their little yin-yang, Yaddle wanted to teach him her ways too, but Yoda strongly refused. They had a falling out, and Yaddle returned to Dagobah. (Grogu was born between I and II, and Yaddle's seat on the Jedi council is empty in II)

Being defeated by Palpatine, and unsure of his son's fate, Yoda wanted to go back to Yaddle and apologize, learn her ways, work together to navigate this treacherous new world to find their lost son, and live in loving exile free from the Jedi and the Sith... But when he arrived, he met her force ghost instead, bound to the strong energies unique to Dagobah. Together they discussed the fate of the galaxy, decided to leave their son to decide his own fate rather than drag him back into the conflicts of the Jedi. Yaddle allowed her ghost to become one with the Force, and Yoda got to properly say goodbye this time."

So, i'm no ""Star Wars grand lore master"", this crap stuck into my mind while i was kinda high but anyway.
I think we all know Bendu, from Rebels, he claims to be ""the one in the middle"", quite litterally the definition of balance in the Force.
So, Anakin is the choosen one to bring this damn balance, the Jedi order thought that this would mean destroying the Sith but, as we all know, the Jedi were kinda losing their way through the last days of the Republic; becoming soldiers rather than ""keepers of the peace"" or balance. Then, Anakin destroys the order and, 20 years later, kills Palps, ending the Siths. Anyway all this shit was just an excuse to say: how cool would have been to see a sequel were the antagonist/protagonist, maybe Kylo, was a """"Maul type character"""", maybe inspired by Bendu himself, that wanted to finish Anakin's legacy by killing all the remaining Sith (inquisitors?) and Jedi."

This would explain why he doesn’t exist in the sequel trilogy, and you know Star Wars is all about prophecies. We have not yet seen time travel, but they can make it happen by going through a rare wormhole or something.

Also, I’ve always wondered what Grogu’s larger purpose is. What is his calling? Why is he so important in this new part of Star Wars lore? Surely not to just chase frogs and force freeze a couple bad guys.

Could be a nice finale to The Mandalorian when they decide to end it eventually."

In particular Yoda, “to Corrascaunt go you must, jedi archives you access if Jedi grandmaster you are to become”. His eyes open and he leaves to his X-wing. He arrives and Corrascaunt is as busy as ever. And he marches up to the temple steps. Barron and emptied. He can feel the pain and suffering that had occurred here. To which Anakin then appears “my son, the very temple you are in… was where Vader had taken over, i marched here with the 501st leigon of clone troopers, and i slaughtered everyone, masters knights, padawans and younglings. Its best you here it from me. And not see it.”

They talk for a few seconds and Anakin disappears “goodbye for now my son, i love you”.

Luke walks through the halls admiring the architecture of the temple and how hauntingly hollow it is. He proceeds to the the very centre of the temple and feels are dark pull. He realises there is a sith temple right underneath to which he remarks “not today, another time”. He then enters the archives, he now encounters Qui-Gon, “hello young Skywalker, i too ventured to the restricted zone for more knowledge when i became a master. I was Obi-Wan’s master and you are everything great about him and your father. However i warn you no to fall to the dogmatic views of the Jedi and not to the darkness. When your venture here is over, look for the teachings of a Jedi referred to as Revan.” He disappears before Luke can get in a word.

Ok so i cant keep this detail up now so let me just run down the ideas. He enters and reads a bunch of things and learns from a bunch of holocrons. This would be able to canonise some things not touched upon or fleshed out in canon, he takes these holocrons:
-Cin Drallig teaching every lightsaber form
-Plo Koon and electric judgement
-Mace Windu and Vapad
Some texts on different key jedi locations and things on the sith. 

I think it would be very cool to see his journey to being grandmaster despite the sequels. Maybe it could add some depth to his failure."

And what if Jocasta Nu and the other masters made plans to warn the other Jedi about Order 66, evacuate the temple, and destroy it? Which Jedi Masters and Padawans would survive and which would still die? - So what if in ""The Lost One"" instead of finding out that Sifo-Diyas worked with Dooku to create the Clone Army, Anakin, Obi-wan, and Rex, find out that he was working with Hego Damask to create the Clone Army. During their investigation they stumble upon Ahsoka, who along with her friend Hondo and her boyfriend Nyx Okami are also looking for Hego Damask Observatory, but more in the hopes of finding treasure instead of the truth about the Clone Army. Nevertheless Ahsoka is glad to see Anakin and Rex again. Unfortunately the reunion is cut short when they discover Damask's Observatory only to find old Sith Artifacts and lab equipment. Upon activating an old holoprojector which recorded Damask's research they find out that he was actually a Sith Lord by the name of Darth Plagueis.

They head back to the ship with Ahsoka's crew in tow and try to make sense on why Damask would want to create the Clone Army and how to proceed further. Rex brings up the inhibitor chips, that Fives was investigating and suggest that they start their. He volunteers to have them study his chip to figure out the Sith's plan but before they get the chance they are called back to Coruscant to rescue Palpatine.

Anyway most of the events of ROTS continue as planned, only this time Ahsoka sticks around with Nyx who has been hired to crack the inhibitor chip. Nyx cracks the chip, revealing Order 66 to Windu, Ahsoka, and the other masters at the temple. When they figure out that Order 66 can only be voice-activated Mace asks who has the ability to activate it that's when Anakin comes in revealing to everyone the truth about Palpatine being a Sith Lord. Mace become paranoid and decides to take matters into his own hands and arrest Palpatine and takeover the Senate. When Ahsoka voices her objections to the plan, on moral grounds Windu harshly reminds her that she is no longer a Jedi, fueling Anakin's hatred towards the council. Jocasta suggests they try contacting the other Jedi to warn them and evacuating the Temple, but Mace forbids her and the other Masters from doing so to prevent tipping off Sidious.

Jocasta decides to act anyway and works with Ahsoka and some of the other Jedi at the temple to telepathically warn the Jedi across the galaxy about Order 66 and Sidious. Then they begin evacuating the temple and prepare their defenses for the oncoming onslaught. Unfortunately Anakin still falls to the dark side and leads the attack. At first the Jedi Defenders are able to use their knowledge of the Temple's layout to their advantage but they are eventually overwhelmed by superior numbers. Jocasta and Tera Sinube engage Anakin in a duel. He beats them both but not before Jocasta destroys the temple to prevent the Jedi's knowledge and artifacts from falling into Sith Hands.

251,1658015839.0,StarWarsTheories,"If Grievous killed Obi Wan - The popular theory is that Anakin would just fall faster to the dark side following his masters death; giving into Palpatine’s influence. But remember, Anakin finds out that Kenobi defeated Gervious right before he tells Windu that Palapatine is the sith they’ve been looking for.[A Sith LORD?!](https://youtu.be/jIjKogrfsdo) So what would happen if Windu broke the news to Anakin that his master has fallen at that moment?

If Anakin decides to tell Windu about Palpatine, Windu would still tell Anakin to wait in the council chambers but its very likely Anakin would leave Coruscant all together to find Grievous and avenge his master; leaving Windu to handle Palpatine without any interruptions. Anakin would undoubtedly destroy Grievous and after Windu defeats Palpatine, the war would be over. Though Anakin didn’t follow orders, his victory would have been a major part in ending the war and the council would more than likely grant Anakin the rank of master for his strength alone after defeating the enemy that his master couldn’t (like Kenobi did so long ago).

But in the event that Anakin withholds this information, of course he would fall faster to the dark side but Padme would give a safe birth without Kenobi there to provoke anakin and his fear of Padme dying at birth was his ONLY reason to seek the dark side so he may lose all ambition to become a Sith.

255,1656781091.0,StarWarsTheories,"The Real Identity of Darth Sidious - Having read so many theories, this is something I think sheds new light on the entire franchise. 

Let's start with Legends. Darth Bane creates the rule of two. One Master, One apprentice. He says without it the sith will fall apart. We also know found and studied ancient sith scrolls, specifically on essence transfer. He also learned the his orbalisk armor limited some of his ability to use some of those techniques, yet he was dependent on them.

So, Darth Bane resolves to 1. Create the rule of 2, and 2. Upon his death, once free from the orbalisks transfer his essence into his apprentice. He then continues this ritual, finding stronger people in the force, pulling them to the dark side, training them, and when they become stronger than him, they kill his current host and he transfers into the next one. Periodically projecting his Darth Bane persona into his tomb, like Luke did in the sequels to keep the ruse alive. 

Palpatine is just as obsessed as Bane was in acquiring ancient Sith knowledge. It's this knowledge he uses to use the midiclorians to create Anakin, his next stronger replacement. He generally isn't seen too concerned about his death EXCEPT at the beginning of episode 2. Why? Well because his replacement, Anakin, was also in danger of dying. He uses sith sorcery to drain Padme's life to restore Anakin's, something Darth Bane was able to do. But he didn't heal himself you say? Why would he? If his goal is to fuel Anakin's hate, that face is a constant reminder of the moment he turned, and plus he's gonna get a new body anyway, which he can force heal as Bane was known to do.

But, then why cripple Vader with his suit, preventing him from rising up against him. I think it's 2 fold. In draining Padme's life, he sensed the birth of Luke and Leia. At this point, he's stalling, again playing the long game until he can turn either one of the twins. If Vader overcomes those restrictions, he still wins cause that just shows Vader's strength, and he can just inhabit Vader's body. Again, then use Vader to turn and eventually inhabit one of the twins. This is why in ROTJ Palps doesn't flinch when Luke swings at him. Even if Vader doesn't save him, Luke still gives in yo the dark side, kills him and he transfers to Luke.

This theory also explains how Sidious could have survived that fall. Darth Bane could literally heal a knife cut as it sliced him. He was able to heal himself enough to find a way of the death star. We then see him targeting Ben and Rey in the sequels. Again, choosing the strongest to corrupt and eventually inhabit. So in the final installment, when Sidious talks about becoming all the Sith, yes all the one Sith, Darth Bane, because he has been all the sith for generations."

257,1656103610.0,StarWarsTheories,"Why Mara Jade won't come back as Luke's wife -   

There has been a lot of speculation recently that Luke’s wife could make her way back into canon. While this sounds interesting, I’m not so sure she should even if she could. There just seems to be too many factors not in her favor. 

I have been doing some research into Star Wars Lore for a project I’m doing in an attempt to learn how to be a writer. Much of it having to do with what I feel should or shouldn’t be brought back into canon. In reading some interviews with George Lucas I have come to an assumption that there are three areas Lucas seems to want to stay away from, those being the Yuuzhan Vong, many characters and events surrounding the mmo SW:toR and Luke’s family. I realize it was Disney that removed the EU from canon, but all indications are that it is Lucas’s vision that is driving what is being reintroduced.

In addition, if you look at the events of the sequel trilogy and the back story created for it, Luke would have been training a class of future Jedi by at least 15 ABY, with the Academies destruction coming at around 28 ABY. Supposedly, this class of younglings were to be the start of a new Jedi Order which would mean that Luke was the only one there to watch over them. In attempting to verify that notion I had to look into the planets history. 

Lukes Academy was built on Ossus which was destroyed by Naga Sadow  4 millennia earlier. After which the only surviving sentients were a few force users who apparently went feral and forgot how to use the force after some time. In the interim between Ossus’s destruction and the Academy being built, there are a few accounts of some archeology taking place and a rumor of a CIS base but no mention of anyone inhabiting the system except possibly the Ysannan, with no mention of them contributing to the Academy. Also considering he spent “years” after the Battle of Jakku looking for Ach-to, and depending on just how many years that was, Luke would have had very little time for romance.

According to Legend, Luke and Mara didn’t get together till 19 ABY which would have had Luke being busy with the Academy and approximately 14 years into his search. Now it’s very possible things could be going on with them on the background, but I am not so sure. There has never been any mention of her anywhere in canon and the story has advanced to a point there her window of opportunity has closed. I think that if she ever did make it to canon it would be in a very brief time with Luke before they killed off a character that Lucas never really cared for anyway. Other possibilities could be as another angry Darksider, or a redeemed Darksider that becomes a mentor to Rey, or somewhere in her career in the Smugglers Alliance. But as Luke’s wife? I don’t see it.

Watto has the critical part the ship is missing, so any value lost by the bum hyperdrive is almost moot from his perspective. a rolls royce or yacht missing its engine would probably be worth a lot less than simply subtracting the value of the missing part so he'd get a fat discount if he didn't disclose he didn't have the part, and then upon sale he'd make a fatter profit.

Why didn't watto or Qui Gon suggest a sort of trade in deal? watto taking and selling the bum ship and giving them outer rim currency for it, and either sending them off or offering them another ship (one he owns or he has the connections to acquire.)

And maybe if Qui Gon wanted to keep a low profile he could ask that the ship to only be sold after they leave planet, having watto leverage a loan from someone or somewhere to get the ship in the interim.

or watto can stab them in the back when payments due, say something like ""I've got you on a freighter that'll get you to coriscant"" not actually buying them a ship but at least getting them from point A to B, the only thing the gang needed at the time.

aswell as having a time restraint on the deal, they where on tatooine for ... fourish days or so, I could imagine Watto chomping at the bit and making the calls needed if told the deal had a strict time limit, they'd prob get ofworld faster in this scenario if watto was halfway decent at business.

268,1655272071.0,StarWarsTheories,"The future of Grogu (as of Book of Boba Fett) - This is a theory I had prior to Book of Boba Fett and since that shows release it actually has some support.

The first part to the theory is that Din Djarin will become the next great Mandalore. Since he now holds the Dark Saber and is the main character of The Mandalorian, this feels likely.

Alongside this comes Grogu's decision in the Book of Boba Fett to leave the path of the jedi to rejoin Din as a mandalorian. Now the Yoda species is mostly not understood but we do know they live extremely long lives Yoda dying at 900. Now Grogu should far outlive Din and if Din is slain in battle this would lead Grogu to feel pain and loss and be pushed to the dark side possibly slaying Din's killer and obtaining the dark saber and as a powerful force using mandalorian, Grogu could become Mandalore the Eternal. Grogu would live for centuries guiding the mandalorians into prosperity and maybe even conquer parts of the galaxy. 

This could lead to multiple paths. Grogu following part of the jedi path could make a more peaceful mandalore. Or what could be more exciting would be a Grogu broken by the loss of Din at such a young age turning to the dark side and becoming the next main Star Wars villain as a mandalorian conquerer.

I was just rewatching Empire again, as one does, and realized that this quote has never made a bit of sense.

Seeing how the Disney era of SW has tasked it self with attempting to fill every conceivable plothole (while creating many of their own new ones...) this got me thinking a bit.

-The Kenobi series is centered around Ben protecting the twins.
-How Leia knew Kenobi has now been established but we aren't sure how Luke met him yet.
-Kenobi knows that Yoda is on Dagobah.
-For some reason Luke vaguely remembers Dagobah.

Is it possible that at some point we will see old Ben hiding Luke on Dagobah from an Imperial sweep?

Unlikely, but just wondering what this damn quote means."

Here is my interruption based on the new show.  Obviously Leia knows Kenobi. The reason she say last the line “ Years ago you served my father in the Clone wars…” is NOT because she’s trying to jog his memory it’s because … 

A. It’s a message from her Father and 

B. The context of the message is regarding the rebellion. She’s using the fact that he once fought for the galaxy as a reminder they need him again.
She’s starts with “General Kenobi” they need General Kenobi back in the fight. 

So it’s not about reminding him who she is, it’s reminding him who he is.

In obi wan, episode 3 he could have  easily killed obi wan… but let’s him get away more or less.

In episode 6 he turns on the chancellor with Luke after failed assassination attempts…

What if the whole time he wasn’t fully devoted to the dark side and at each of these steps he ALLOWED the downfall of the empire through small but crucial moments. ALLOWING the downfall of the Sith ultimately?

Later on in the trailer, you can see Commander Cody and Crosshair doing a mission together. If Cody were to get the Bad Batch's help (which might be since he appears two to three times in the trailer) then Crosshair might be among them once again. In the trailer, it also shows Wrecker blowing things up with what looks like Crosshair in the action too. John Favreau and Dave Filoni also have tended to listen to the fans on numerous occasions.

Not to mention that together they know every secret the empire has. They know weaknesses they know where every doomsday weapon is, and palpatine is a tactical genius, who always has contingency plans.

So please give it a try if you haven’t already. For all of you that have seen Resistance, I would like to share with you something I noticed upon rewatch: Kaz’s family definitely was working with the First Order. In Season 1 episode 1 of Resistance, on a call with his father, his father refers to the Resistance as “extremists.” It is clear that Kaz has a rocky relationship with his father but we don’t hear much about him for a while. Then, in the finale of season 1, Kaz watches his home planet, Hosnium prime, be destroyed. And he believes that his family is on there and was destroyed too. 
Kaz does not hear anything until towards the end of season 2 when on another call with his father, his father mentions that the whole family was safe because they were all off-world when it happened. Although Kaz finds this as a relief, it is kind of strange in the fact that why would the entire family be off-world unless there was some reason? Also, the father seemed sort of nonchalant about this as well. It makes sense to me, from his obvious disgust of the resistance and position as a senator, that his father has connections with the first order, and when the first order planned to destroy the Hosnium prime, they made sure to pull out all of their supporters first.
It makes sense to me and I think that if they were able to make a season 3, they would have definitely gone down this route or at least explored more of Kaz’s relationship with his family.

298,1648718890.0,StarWarsTheories,"The rule of two is how Siths keep immortality. Inspired by u/hennytime - So I've read this theory that Sidious has been trying to recreate his master's immortality technique as far back as the death of Dooku and it got me thinking.

If the force ghost is the ultimate way of breaking the chain and surpassing cycle of death and rebirth through force then antithesis of that must be forcibly staying part of the cycle the Sith way.

Which brings me back to an idea that after coming back as a clone Darth Sidious wasn't just himself but all the important Sith lords occupying one ""soul"" in a twisted Avatar: the last airbender way, with Palpatine just being the most recent layer of this twisted unwilling to die being collecting lives to keep itself alive in the dark force.

Plagueis has perfected the immortality technique Sidious tried to use on his students. Which used the natural sith dynamic against the student and allowed the anger and hunger for power catalyst master into taking students body when he tries to take over and kill him. I mean in my head that was the Plagueis scheme, find somebody that's hungry for power, soft spinned and with some force abilities but not as good or powerful as him. And when they're ready let yourself get killed, duping then in giving away their body for you as a vessel. Except Sidious' main power is hiding really well his true strength, so in his case he was just too strong in will and dark side to succumb to his master.

The main theory goes, this is the true meaning of the rule of two. Going probably as far as Bane or possibly as far as Sith.

Siths create this power vaccum so they can pass from old body to a younger one when the time has come. That's why there're always two, there's the master containing all the Siths and their unwillingness to leave the circle of life and death and start a new life and there's an apprentice preparing his body to become a master and take on the new host. Of course, like in case of Sidious, many times it's the apprentice who's will is stronger and becomes the new top layer of this consciousness. But with every subsequent death in this chain of killing the amalgam of all the lord's is getting passed on.

When the students kills the master they don't just take the title they become all the Sith. And of course when Sidious' body died on Death Star his will took a hit that's why in the Rise of Skywalker there're moments he feels more like a group of people than one person."

First of all, Omega has similair hair to palpetine. But here face looks more like jango amd the rest of the clones (but here face is smoother). This could explain how she would have gotten a conection to the force. 

And if she has palps dna in her she would be a palpetine, making her palps doughter (in a similair way as boba is the son of jango). 

We know that rey is a palpetine. Making the possibility even bigger. 

But is Omega stil alive during the og triologie. 
Well yes. In the first season of the bad batch we see teen versions of hera senduila and caleb who we know to be around during episode 4 to 6. Both are in there late 30e.

It was his idea to offer for Luke to join them rather than just kill him, whereas if it had been anyone else, he probably would've gone straight to kill.

Just like how a lot of babies in real life do, in a way, kill their mothers during the childbirth process (I know that's a strong word, but in a way the mother's life is sacrificed just by nature for the sake of the baby's survival), piggybacking off of the other theory could infant Luke and Leia have been draining their mother's life force so they could both survive?

Possibly it could be that they are teasing the main villain of the upcoming avengers like star wars movie that will appear at some point in the future this could be George Lucas, Jon Favreau and Dave Filoni's true vision of the next installment.

A strong twist that no one saw coming."
311,1644713172.0,StarWarsTheories,"Book of Boba Fett Season 2 Predictions (spoilers for season 1) - Now that the Mandalorian and Grogu are back on track for season 3, I hope Disney does more with the Book of Boba Fett in a possible second season. 

With Boba's defeat of the Pike Syndicate in chapter 7, it may be possible that another crime organization will challenge him. My guess is that Crimson Dawn will return, since I believe that the pikes were part of it during clone wars, to challenge Boba for Tatooine. This could lead to the return of Qi'ra and possibly other characters that she may have recruited, such as Bossk (and maybe Cad Bane since I don't think he's dead). I could see some rivalry between Bossk and Krrsantan, similar to the trandoshan fight in the bar during chapter 4. I also hope to see the Marshal become a series main stay, with him being healed/upgraded with Boba's help.

 With the return of Qi'ra, maybe we might also see a cameo from none other than Han Solo. This would make sense, seeing as how Han was the man who seemingly killed Boba in Return of the Jedi.

Of course, all of this is merely speculation, but no matter what they do for season 2, I hope hey get rid of the mods because there is no saving them."

So I just watched episode 5 of The Book of Boba Fett and learned that the Darksaber gets heavier as negative emotions weigh the user down. I think Tarre Vizsala did this in order to help balance being both a Mandalorian and a Jedi.

The lifestyles of Mandalorians and Jedi directly clash; Mandalorians treasure attachment while Jedi shun it.  If Tarre Vizsala ever failed to balance his two cultures, the inner turmoil he would have felt would prevent him from using the Darksaber; a symbol of unified Jedi and Mandalorian teachings."

Not much to go on here, but it was stated that

1. It would be the 'Stranger Things' of Star Wars.
2. That It would feature younger characters (Children or Teens)
3. That some characters from THR initiative may also be featured or appear.

So these are my guesses:

1. Ty Yorrick ends up with kids, battling monsters/force mysteries in space.
2. Ty Yorrick prequel that chronicles her childhood/teenage years.
3. A series about the childhood of Marchion Ro and his family's/Elders' history with the differences they had  with Jedi.
4. A continuation or spin-off about Masters Lily Tora-Asi & Arkoff with their padawans at a Jedi outpost...

Again, not a lot to go on, except that The Stranger Things comparison makes it seem force mythos related and/or potentially dark, despite the age of many of it's characters.

But what do you guys think? Any other ideas?!"
315,1644229779.0,StarWarsTheories,"This is me trying to work out the Plot around Mace being alive - Im not a huge fan of the theory but i wanted to make sense if Mace ended up alive:

&#x200B;

1. The person that saved Grogu - would they have enough time to stow away Grogu? (hints are Bariss office is seen in the grogu escape scene though, could be a red herring)
2. After Mace saves himself after flying out the Window, he would have been sure that the Jedi temple would be in danger. He would be the only Jedi that knew that anakin fell to the Darkside at this point.
3. Mace may not have fallen all the way into coruscant depths. he could have grabbed onto a Flying car like anakin did in EP2 (not to mention half of maul survived a great fall and became a main character in the clone wars)
4. Mace would harbour deep resentment to Anakin. Surely he would not believe a Sith like Anakin to be the chosen one?
5. So putting all these things together, it would be great that Mace would now not believe Anakin to be the chosen one of prophecy, and instead put his faith in a youngling with a super high Midichlorian (M) count...... Our Boy grogu.

And this is Mace's motivation, to help train the true chosen one(in his head) and bring balance to the force.

Not only that but he was looking the other way when Cad drew so he was definitely thrown off. Cob was shot when his blaster was pointed at Cad so I think if he wasn’t distracted he could’ve definitely gotten that shot off.

After failing to recruit Bossk, Boba and Krrsantan recruit another bounty hunter, maybe Dengar or Embo.

The end of the episode will have Boba, Krrsantan and the new bounty hunter(my bets on Embo) arrive at Boba’s (Jabba’s) Palace where Fennec and Mando await.

We may even see Mandalorians living underground too, and just like the Armorer said the Mythosaur shall rise up once more (which could have a double meaning).   


Perhaps the Mythosaur are maybe even responsible for the creation of Beskar much like the Sandworms of Arakkis are responsible for spice production in Dune? If this were true, it would bring further meaning to that line about the Beskar in the hilt of the Darksaber being of a higher quality as it would have come directly from the source. This would not be unheard of either, as Krayt Dragons were capable of producing pearls which could be used to power a lightsaber (at least in legends), so perhaps Beskar is a mineral produced by the ""Dragons of Mandalore"" the Mythosaur."

328,1643093277.0,StarWarsTheories,"Who would've raised Leia if Senator Organa hadn't stepped up - I've posted something similar on another sub and a lot of people disagreed but I believe that Leia COULD HAVE gone to her biological grandparents.

Think about it. The Naberries were nobody's. When Padme's safety was so compromised that she needed 24/7 Jedi protection, she was still comfortable introducing Anakin to her family in her hometown like it was the most natural thing in the world (Attack of the Clones deleted scene). 

In the other post I mentioned, I saw so many people saying that Leia being raised by her biological grandparents was too suspicious/risky. People, Luke went to ANAKIN'S FAMILY and took his last name! Vader never found out. I doubt he's checking up on his ex-in laws. 

Why did these sweet innocent people have to spend the rest of their lives thinking that their daughter AND grandchild (they didn't know it was twins) were dead? I think they could've kept a secret.

Padme had a sister too. Maybe she could've passed Leia off as her own daughter of she needed to. Don't a lot of young moms and grandparents do that in real life? 

I'm 90% sure this isn't the case, but I like to imagine that even under the Organas care, Leia still was able to have some sort of relationship with her mother's family. We do know that she knew she was adopted, so it wasn't a secret from her. My own mother was raised by an adoptive parent but she still had a relationship with her biological grandparents for a time. Having three sets of grandparents, how cool is that?"
329,1643041653.0,StarWarsTheories,"Palpatine and Padme Theory - It is well known that Padme Amedala comes from a wealthy noble family on Naboo, growing up to become the queen and a senator. There is another character that has a similar family status and similar upbringings. Sheeve Palpatine was this other character, growing up in a wealthy and noble family, growing up to be a senator and Chancellor. There are many cases in our world of wealthy families having some sort of blood connection at some point, so it would not only be possible for naboo families, but probable. Since Disney took over the Star Wars lore and the legends books were made non-canon, there is not a lot known about Padme's and Palpatine's families' pasts, making this theory completely possible. 
    Given that Padme and Palpatine share the same blood, it gives a new light to many things in the star wars universe. First off, Padme's children, Luke and Leia. Much like Luke's father, he struggled with the balance of the light and dark side, the only difference is Luke succumbed to the darkside far faster and easier than Anakin did. It took years of trauma and losing trust in the Jedi council for Anakin to fall to the darkside. However, for Luke, he naturally fell to darker tendencies and gave into his hate and anger far faster than his father. If we know that Luke has not only his father's blood, but also the blood of palpatine, this would make a lot more sense. We saw this very struggle with Rey during the sequel trilogy. Now knowing that Rey herself is a Palpatine, her struggle with the force makes a lot of sense, her story even mirroring lukes in a way. Both easily falling for the darkside powers, testing their abilities using their emotions while fighting. Ben Solo also fits into this category as well, but in a bit of the opposite way. Ben Solo, turning to Kylo Ren, gave himself to the darkside with little resistance, only having a struggle when being pulled to the light. If you really think about it, there should be little reason that Ben should fall to the darkside, he grew up with Luke Skywalker at his side, without a trace of the darkside, yet when he hears Snokes voice in his head (Which we know is Palpatine talking to him) he easily gets seduced. This again does not make sense given his teachings. It begins to make sense if we know he has the same blood as palpatine himself. Kylo/Ben struggles with the pull of the light, as he struggles to balance the Skywalker and Palpatine in his blood. 
    The connection between Rey and Ben had always bothered me. The concept of a Dyade in the force is shaky at best. Sure, the skywalkers and palpatines had crossed paths in the past, as it was the entire plot of the first two trilogies, but that does not give a lot of justification for the connection through the force. Now let's assume that Ben is part palpatine as well, from his grandmother's family connection. This gives a direct blood connection between Rey and Ben, allowing the dyade to connect them not only in the force, but in blood. 
            As seen in episode 9, Palpatine was able to take the life force from both Ben and Rey, now if this power is available at all times, why wouldn’t he use it on all of his enemies? Because he can only use it to his own blood, both Rey and Ben would have that blood. There is another popular theory that Palpatine took Padme's life essence to keep Anakin alive after his battle on Mustafar. Once again this would only make sense if he could only perform this act on his own blood line. This gives reason why he could only use this power on these three particular people."

334,1642210016.0,StarWarsTheories,"Tusken Tribe worship Anakin/Vader-like Deity - When I was watching through Book of Boba Fett, it always struck me interesting the way that these Tuskens dressed. Almost all of them are dressed in dark garments - contrary to the usual tan or yellowish garments that the Tuskens typically wear in other series, like the Mandalorian or even the films. 

Turns out Star Wars Explained covered it a bit, but I'll try to develop on it further. 

I don't think this is just there to distinguish them. After all, on the concept art we see some of the Tuskens wearing normal robes. So why was this changed? They could have easily just gone with the normal robes. To distinguish them, they could have added certain patterns, changed some of their ornaments... why specifically this design? Almost as much black as possible, with some hints of red?

While from Marvel's Darth Vader comic series we know at least some Tuskens worshipped Vader, there is some more ground to the theory.

First off, the leader: he seems to have long hair showing off. Now this is strange: in Tusken tradition, we know that they are not supposed to show off any part of their body, they could be killed for that. But this Tusken in specific has gone with that choice. Is it either because he is trying to imitate Vader and thought the back part of his helmet looked like hair? Or is he, however unlikely, imitating Shmi who brought down the curse of Anakin upon them in the first place? Who knows. 

Second, as Star Wars Explained mentioned, both the women and the children know how to fight. And if you know the Prequels, you probably know why that's important... 

""...and not just the men, but the women, and the children too!""

Yeah, I somehow don't think that's a coincidence. 


Third, the pyre funeral. Now as we know, the Tusken worshippers of Vader burned the lone survivor on the pyre, in front of a giant Vader statue. They could have possibly adopted the tradition from that event, ironically imitating how Vader's own body was cremated. Poetic if you ask me. Then again, they could have had that tradition even before Vader came around so this one is slightly weaker. 


Fourth, they claim the other tribes are more aggressive. Now there is an interesting connection here: the tribes that captured Shmi, obviously, attacked a human settler, and they got punished for that. Is this tribe trying to please their ""god"" by not attacking the settlers and incurring his wrath again? They also don't sacrifice their prisoners (notably the Rodian and Boba) like the other Tuskens did with Shmi, instead having them do work to help out the tribe.

Five, they have a strong warrior culture. Anakin, as we all know, was a Jedi, and he grew to be an outstanding melee warrior at that. These Tuskens also seem to be very dedicated towards learning the martial arts, yet they don't use them too often to attack those who haven't wronged them. Is it this also to please their warrior god? It would be cool to think these Tuskens are Jedi imitators, brings similarities to the crafting of the gaffi stick and the lightsaber construction ceremony.


With all of this, I suspect that the Tuskens in Book of Boba Fett might be worshippers of a deified version of Anakin Skywalker/Darth Vader, and that version of the Chosen One became a warrior deity in their already rich culture.

It would be a cool twist for the show. While they already shown the legacy of Jabba the Hutt and how his Empire really fell, this Tusken Tribe could be a reminder of Boba's other employer, Anakin Skywalker/Darth Vader, and the subtle marks that he left on the Star Wars universe..."

At the end of the season, boba fett has gotten what he's wanted. He beat the twins, becomes to dog, and rules with respect. Celebrating on his throne, he gets word that there's a visitor with an urgent message for him. He brushes it off and says it can wait till morning. But the servant then says it's a mandalorian, and that gets bobas attention to meet with him privately. We then enter a room where there's a twilek with mandalorian armor on (no other reason than I think it would be cool to see alien mandos). The mandalorian says that his clan has heard of his victory over the hutts, and that his victory is the stuff legends are made of. For that, his clan and several others find him to be a worthy contestant for the title of mandalore. The episode and season ends with a close up of boba fetts face with helmet on.

Like I said I doubt this is the way the show would go, but it'd be such an amazing direction to take it. How would boba react? Would he be completely disinterested, or would he be overwhelmed? Would this cause conflict with din and his technical claim and him having the darksaber? How would this align with his status as crime lord? Who knows.

337,1641690362.0,StarWarsTheories,"The True Intent of the Whills - **The True Intent of the Whills**

Theory of who the Whills are and the objective they seek

Part 1: The Nature of the Whills 

*Adventures of Luke Starkiller , As Taken From the Journal of the Whills.* The Journal of the Whills, once just a forgotten potential title for what we will come to know as *Star Wars,* but also a cannon element, crucial to the greater Star Wars narrative. The Whills are described as a community of beings that continually watch and influence the Star Wars universe as we know it. They have a symbiotic relationship with the iMidi-Chlorians, microscopic lifeforms who bind the universe together and reside in all living things, creating what we know as the force. The Whills feed on the force and use it to create the universe and set all things in motion, some may call this creating destinies or fate. They are able to guide living beings to find their fate or destiny through Shamen of the Whills. These Shamen of the Whills are avatars created to bridge the Physical and spiritual world, thus separating the living force from the cosmic. In essence, the Whills are what we can equate to Gods, laying the groundwork for the universe and all that come from it. It is unknown how much involvement they truly have in the physical universe, only that they have the ability to watch and record all that happens.

Part 2: Interpretation of the Whills

While the origin of where the whills come from is unknown, it is up to the individual to fill in the gaps and the story that has yet to be told. Evidence can be pointed that these beings are multiple and have a consensus of some kind, meaning it is plausible that there could have been a physical representation at some point. This makes me believe these beings were once primitive life forms, the first to have contact with and connect to the Midi-Chlorians. As stated before, Midi-Chlorians are microscopic life forms that bind the physical universe together, and reside in all thriving things. The communication and connection to these Midi-Chlorians allowed these primitives to tap into what we know as the force, and begin to unlock its power. Thus, creating a new reality in which living beings can access the force and all the power that comes with it. This is where I find the best evidence for the Whills, these primitive beings, to create the universe, or rather change it and recreate it. The primitives being in an environment unbothered by politics and dogmas of modern civilization, they could focus on all aspects of the force, not separating it into light and dark. The force comes in two parts, which will later be deemed as the Lightside and the Darkside. 

Starting with the light, this portion of the force focuses on loving the universe around you and protecting it without getting attached. Learning to let go while having compassion for everything, external growth. While, what is known as the dark, is the focus of self care and seeking the power to be the best version of oneself. Learning to look inward, finding the destroying flaws within, internal growth. Only with both aspects of the force working simultaneously, can one find true enlightenment. The primitives were able to balance both, transcending the physical world, leaving it behind, yet still connected to it, becoming the Whills. 

While in this state of almost God-like power, the Whills attempt to guide others to find the force and join them in  enlightenment, however, these individuals are corrupted by the pulls of light and dark, unable to join them and find balance. This creates factions of dark and light users, later deemed Jedi and Sith, that later adopt laws and motives, each unable to see the true nature of the force. As time goes on, the divide only gets deeper, with civilization and politics blinding anyone to find true balance. 

There are well known force sensitive artifacts called Kyber Crystals. These Kyber Crystals have a very strong connection to the force, even going as far as being semi sentient. These Kyber crystals are bonded with the cosmic force and are the objects that allow lightsabers to work as they do. Kyber is found on the planet Illum, where the jedi go to find their crystals that call out to them. Once the jedi are in possession of the crystal, the lightside of the force influences the color of the blade to mainly a blue or green. The influence of the lightside bonds the crystals to the living force, however this is only the first step into becoming pure balanced crystals. From there it is on the duty of the darkside to make the kyber “bleed” (not as flesh bleeds, but as a term to describe discovering what is deep inside) a red hue, using darkside emotions to entertain the kybers next step in balance, a change inside itself. In order to come to complete balance, the crystal must be rid of all color by introducing the light back into it, without removing the darkside, thus becoming completely balanced in the light and dark, as well as the living and cosmic force.

The first step in enlightenment is later discovered, seen in the Force Ghosts. This is when true understanding of selflessness and non attachment is achieved. They are able to maintain their consciousness after death, and live with a foot in the cosmic force, as well as the living force. They detach themselves from their physical body whether it is disappearing into the cosmic force, or having their body turned into energy through cremation, this is why we are allowed to see Anakin Skywalker as a force ghost, even though his physical body had not disappeared. One individual who is widely accepted to not have the ability to become a force ghost while still maintaining their consciousness is Qui Gon Jinn. He explains to Yoda that his training in the cosmic force and life after death is incomplete, however that does not mean he is not capable of completing it after death. We see potential evidence of this in the Mortis arc in “The Clone Wars,” which will be touched on later. The “body” like ghosts we see, that have been known to still interact with the physical world, whether it be merely sitting on a log, moving vines, or as powerful as creating a lighting storm. This could be the midichlorians acting alone, without the physical body. It takes the shape and appearance of those who they had, and still have a symbiotic relationship with. The soul and consciousness lives on in the cosmic force, while the midichlorians live on in the living force. While this is a step in the right direction, it is still not true enlightenment, as they did not master the darkside, truly unlocking their full potential and power within themselves. Only by balancing both 100% can it be achieved. 

Part 3: The Prophecy

""A Chosen One shall come, born of no father, and through him ultimate balance in the Force will be restored."" This is a prophecy received by the Jedi, in which they understand it to be the destruction of the darkside, allowing the light to reign supreme. However, this is grossly misread. If we break it down into each line, it can be seen as a test by the Whills to find a successor to their power, an attempt to have another find true balance and enlightenment. The first line goes as follows, “A Chosen One shall come.” This can be seen as one picked out by the Whills, one they choose to bear the burden of their test. “Born of no father” for the one we have chosen will be conceived by us, created from the living force to be our champion. “And through him” meaning within him, as an individual. “Will ultimate balance in the force,” he will master both the light and the dark concurrently. “Will be restored” back to the way we have created it, not separate, but as on, as the Whills. Broken down, this prophecy had been completely misread and used to corrupt and destroy the test that the Whills had laid out.  

This brings us to the Mortis arc from “The Clone Wars.” During this arc, many universe altering events take place that change the way we look at the chosen one and the force as a whole, at face value. However, looking at it from the perspective that has been laid out, this could be seen as Anakin's final test by the whills, to see if he can truly become one with the force and join them. While Obi Wan has, what could be a vision, or a visit from Qui Gon’s force ghost (Still up for debate if it was truly Qui Gon or not) it is stated that the Daughter, the Son, and the Father (Representing the light, dark, and balance respectively) have drawn Anakin to Mortis as they believe he is the chosen one. If the Jedis interpretation of the prophecy was correct, it would not make sense for these three individuals to seek out Anakin, as their goal was to keep Anakin on Mortis to achieve balance. Not to destroy the darkside, but conquer it, along with the light. It is possible these three individuals were the first attempt by the Whills of testing living beings to become one with the force years prior, but obviously had failed due to the corrupting nature of the dark and light side. That is why the father wants Anakin to take his place as he is the next, presumably improved, test subject.

This brought about the failure of the Chosen One, Anakin Skywalker. Anakin was the vessel chosen and created by the Whills to be the next perfect being to find enlightenment. They created him to see if it is still possible to overcome the modern dogma and society and transcend the universe. However, this had turned out to be a failure, as the divide between light and dark turned out to be too far. First, Anakin was pulled to the light, forced to remove all attachment without learning the true love for them. This created conflict, later pushing Anakin to seek power for himself, not to boost his connection to the force, but for selfish intent, a vain physical attachment to the universe. The wrong messages were conveyed on each side, inhibiting Anakin's understanding of balance, blocking his path to enlightenment. The Failure of Anakin had proven to the Whills it is impossible for any to join them in transcendence. It is now their job to continue along the path of time and space, only to view and record the vast future of a galaxy far, far away."

342,1640317925.0,StarWarsTheories,"Why Midichlorians Matter - Why Midichlorians Matter

Now. I am not one to seek out fan theories. So this may already be out there. It is something that I conceived (no pun intended) myself in my own daily Star Wars ponderings while doing the dishes.

Padme didn’t die from a broken heart. She was able to tap into the Force without her knowledge due to her love and desire to protect her newborn children from Anakin/Darth Vader.

Midichlorians are symbiotic with beings in their blood. Qui-Gon Jinn said as much to Anakin as a lad. When Padme got pregnant, she started to grow her own symbiotic relationship with two babies. Now we know that Luke and Leia were both Force sensitive, so Anakin wasn’t shooting Force blanks.

Basic biology tells us that when someone is pregnant, some elements of the blood transfers from parent to the fetus or fetuses. Feti? Probably fetuses. Even though the placenta keeps MOST blood and elements within blood separate, stuff does transfer between. I bet midichlorians do. So. Padme had midichlorians circulating through her, making her symbiotic with the Force.

Padme had a desire to protect her kids and the Force answered. But Padme had no control. Luke died overexerting himself with the Force. Leia also extended herself through the Force and died.

343,1639701266.0,StarWarsTheories,"Mandalorian Post season 2 theory - My theory is on what Mando could do and would be fit into his character, in my opinion.

He is now at a point of total aimlessly and needs to rethink a lot. 
When Gideon told him he is now the ruler of Mandalore, Mando was occupied with Grogu and thought he’d be around for a while longer and didn’t know of Luke at that point.
While he is standing on the bridge and realises that he just lost his sole purpose in his life, protecting Grogu. 
At that point he might consider the position of Mand’alore and take up the mantle. 
The first thing he’d do is of course get there with Bo Katan and her crew. Her purpose is to validate his claim and be his advisor on the Mandalorians and their cultures. 
During the first part of they journey, they’d visit Mandalore and the sector, to reunite the mandalorian people. This would work greatly, as they are from former rival factions and show that they can put their differences aside.
While doing so, they’d use Boba’s underworld network to bring all mandalorian bounty hunters, bodyguards and so on back to mandalore, to create a backbone of society.
Their next part would be to find a path for mandalore, both are more militant and also caring in a certain way. They’d agree on a foundling system for the refugees of the galactic civil war and offer a state education, that includes military training. By doing so, they’d not only get support from surrounding system, but also a request for protection. By providing said protection, they’d get resources and other services. 
By doing so they’d create their own faction, which would rapidly grow in their and the surrounding sectors. 
They’d build up to prevent unwanted underworld activity and imperial or republic actions in their area. Most likely would they have an education system that reminds of more of Kamino than the one in TCW. Barracks with educational areas and exercising grounds. The students would be put into groups if 4 and treated like recruits, regardless of species or gender. 
They’d maybe work together with Boba to ensure a controlled underworld, that wouldn’t pose a thread and invite the bounty hunter guild to mandalore.
As they grow, they’d get both the attention of the new republic and the imperial remnant. 
The new republic would approach them diplomatically at first, maybe by sending maybe sending Sabine Wren or even Luke, because they’ve met before. By doing so she’d be surprised about the Darksaber and would accept Mando’s claim by Bo’s validation of it. 
As they’d be unsure of the new republic, they’d prefer to stay out of it, but trade with them and have a delegation.
The imperial remnant on the other hand would try to infiltrate the mandalorians, especially with Thrawn as it’s head. 
I’m not sure if Thrawn would decide to destroy the mandalorians or use them against the new republic. But maybe he wouldn’t care for Mandalore and ignore it for now, because it’s not that important for his plan.
Their economy would most likely work on both mercenary and export of weaponry. With a good control over the underworld in their realm, they’d definitely have an advantage over the new republic and the imperial remnant.

I think from that point on it’s difficult to predict, they’d definitely take arms against the first order, but I’m not sure, if they’d be isolationist or expand.

346,1638245286.0,StarWarsTheories,"The Fett family armor is ""mass produced beskar"" - In both Canon and Legends, Boba's armor was supposed to be made of durasteel. He didn't get beskar gear until he became the Manda'lor in *The New Jedi Order* books. *The Mandalorian* appears to have retconned this, with Din explicitly referring to Fett's armor as ""the beskar."" Given the religious reverence the Children of Watch possess for the stuff, he would likely be able to tell a knock-off from the real thing. The things that we know carried over from Jango's backstory in *Legends* are as follows:

1. He's an orphan from Concord Dawn who was adopted into a Mandalorian tribe by Jaster Mereel

2. He fought in the Mandalorian Civil Wars between Duchess Satine's New Mandalorians and the first iteration of Death Watch (with some smaller factions maybe thrown into the mix here and there), where their armies were probably much bigger than the small clans and tribes we see floating around in the TV shows (Mandalore is like the British Empire at its peak: she’s got hundreds of colonies, mass conscription doesn't seem beneath them)

3. His gear is pretty standard without any unique variations. He's just got the helmet/cuirass/gauntlets/jetpack kit.

4. He stole the *Slave I* from Oovo IV at some point prior to Episode I tying in with the *Bounty Hunter* game

5. By the time *Attack of the Clones* comes along, he isn't affiliated with any Mandalorian clans and they seek to disassociate themselves from him (Bo-Katan really hates Boba, either because he's a clone or because he refuses to acknowledge her as Manda'lor), suggesting whatever gear Jango has is left over from his days as a foundling.

6. If Din Djarin is any indication, foundlings start off with lesser quality kit and slowly build up their beskar collection since they’ve got no gear to inherit from relatives (look at how easily his first armor gets trashed)

During Japan's militarization in the 1920s and 30s, IJA officers were issued these machine made swords called ""shōwatō."" Most of them were little more than steel blanks with edges ground in, but some of the officers descended from samurai fitted the hilts with their families’ antique blades. To the average Joe, there'd be little difference in appearance, but to those familiar with such things, it would be very noticeable.

**My theory:** Boba Fett's armor is something like that: rather than be made by an armorer, it's more of a one-size-fits-all fare that was mass-produced on an assembly line & only reinforced by beskar. 

That's why it can survive blaster shots and the stomach acids of the Sarlacc, but seems much more easily damageable (his helmet dent was caused by a normal blaster, while Din’s gear shrugs off heavy machine guns, explosives, lightsabers, and robots with super strength). Din's is more like a traditional katana: something that's handmade but *much* more expensive. 

Just as how a samurai's swords were his soul, a Mandalorian's armor is their soul."

349,1636993617.0,StarWarsTheories,"The Real identity of the Armourer - 

So you know the prevailing theory that the armourer is a former Supercommando; she has the short horns on her helmet that look like a zabraks horns. Simple deduction and reasoning. But what if she wasn’t. I have an alternate theory.

Her cult were separate because of their beliefs in a stricter Mandalorian creed, and swore never to reveal their faces in the presence of others.

What if however, instead of being a supercommando she was something else. The Mandalorians were known for accepting anyone regardless of species, inducting aliens into the clans. They would all make personalised armour to reflect the differences in biology or culture.

Theres one other race in starwars who were notorious for their violent ways and never revealing their faces. Who used violent melee weapons like the armourer did. During her last stand she never picks up a blaster which would have most likely been more effective. She uses a simple hammer from the forge. Her armour as a whole seems fairly low tech, no vambraces or any plating beyond the helmet and chest-plate. Everything else is leather.

And, most importantly, she had horns on her helmet. Short and stubby, only a couple, and not like what the Supercommando’s we’ve seen before had.

The Armourer is not dead and with Baby Yoda gone for series 3 she can come back. And one particular group has seen its spotlight in the show, expanding its role. A group where she could return to until she is needed again.

What if one day Deathwatch or mandalorians from before the civil war came across this alien child and inducted her into the group as a foundling. She grows up inside and then, when the group splits, she took charge and imposed the beliefs of her own culture onto these Children of the Watch.

What if The Armourer is a Tusken Raider.

350,1636502195.0,StarWarsTheories,"History of The Tribe - One aspect that I think may be explored in coming seasons is how the Tribe differ so much from other Mandalorians we’ve seen in canon, and why. I have a bit of a running theory that the Tribe are descended from Mauldalorian survivors from the Siege of Mandalore. 

We know Din Djarin was rescued as a child by members of Death Watch during the Clone Wars, so this takes place prior to when Death Watch splits into the Nite Owls and Mauldalorians. The Armourer, who seems to be the leader of the Tribe has the horns emblematic of those who were loyal to Maul after the splitting of Death Watch. It is likely she was once originally one of Maul’s Supercommandos, perhaps even Rook Kast (though that is huge speculation, without much founding in evidence).

At some point after the Clone Wars Bo Katan loses the rulership of Mandalore and is replaced with Gar Saxon. It is possible that either between the Siege of Mandalore and Gar Saxon taking governorship, or when Gar takes over and Sabine and Bo Katan reunite the Mandalorians (however briefly, we still don’t know exactly what happens to them after Rebels Season 4) the Tribe splits off. I would wager it is directly after the defeat of the Mauldalorians at the conclusion to the Siege of Mandalore. 

As the years passed with their separation from the rest of the Mandalorians, the Tribe become more and more stringent in their following of the Way of the Mandalore, which is why we see them so cultish during the The Mandalorian Season 1. During this time, and as Maul became more of a whisper and a legend rather than anything else, I think the Tribe began to shed the affectations and loyalty to him, with the Armourer still keeping her horns as vestiges of this past.

What do you guys think? Could we see something like this idea fleshed out in Mando Season 3, or even perhaps the Bad Batch season 2?"

353,1635628002.0,StarWarsTheories,"[Part 4] Anakin's Mental Struggles and Luke's true heroism (Episode VI) - And finally, we on to the last episode. This theory will involve my previous theory on what I think happened to  Padme in Episode III, so if you did not read please do so now. It is linked here: https://www.reddit.com/r/StarWarsTheories/comments/pstbgp/theory_padmes_force_sensitivity_is_the_reason/?utm_medium=android_app&utm_source=share

Alright, let's finish this. 

By the time Episode VI comes around, Anakin's mental bubble that keeps him distracted from what he had done is starting to deteriorate, but his assignment and then later his master's arrival to the Death Star still keeps him distracted. 

It's not until he meets Luke once more that he finally starts to question his belief in that he is now ""Vader"", the villainous murderer and tyrant who is unworthy of anyone's love, and not Anakin, an idealistic Jedi who deeply cared about his family and for those around him. 

Luke's insistence on that Anakin, is well, Anakin, calls back to Padme's belief on that Anakin can always strive to be better, to atone for what he had done. After Padme's death, Anakin only focused on his mistakes, and how horrifying they were - this is still his emotions preventing him from trying to fix his mistakes and to strive to be a better man, what Padme encouraged him to do in Episode II. 

And it is quite fascinating - while Luke may not even come close to matching Vader's prowess in combat, Luke, mentally-wise, is far more calm and collected. His emotions no longer control his actions, and as such his understanding of how other people may feel has increased as well. As such, Luke now understands how his father feels far better than even Anakin himself now does. So while Anakin may be a master at combat, Luke is the master of the mental game. 

The goal for Luke here is to try to get Anakin to understand that he is still himself, that he is still Anakin and not this ""Vader"" personality he created for himself. And he tries to directly tell that to Anakin, but Ani refuses to accept that at first. However, Anakin's curiosity about his son's progress as a Jedi still does not die out, the same kind of parental curiosity when a dad or mom wants to know how well their son has been doing. By seeing that Luke has already made his new lightsaber, ""Vader"" essentially realizes that his son has pretty much completed his training, and that he is now almost a full fledged Jedi Knight. While Anakin is proud, his body movement and slightly suppressed speech when he says (""Your skills are complete"") does indicate a degree of either sorrow or that he is deep in thought - likely being sorry for that he could not witness himself how Luke has trained, and as he himself says, thinking that the Emperor was indeed right in that he will be capable of becoming a wise and powerful Jedi Knight even without Kenobi. 

Luke sort of uses this to his advantage - by Vader knowing that he is now a Jedi Knight and still insistent on Vader going back to the light, he is showing that he is firm in his belief that at heart Anakin is a good man, and that even him growing wiser does not change that belief in him. To which Vader blindly responds that he must obey his master (Think about it - while Vader wants to bring order, he in Episode V did say himself that the two of then could overthrow the Emperor, so he does not HAVE to obey his master, indicating that at this moment Vader has not truly thought about the reason as to why he is loyal  to the Emperor, all because his emotions about what he did and who he is now are blocking his reasoning about everything else). Luke then right away says what his loyalty to the Emperor will result in: Luke will not want to turn, and then Palpatine will want Vader to kill him or that Vader is forced to kill him (Which is close to what actually happens later, showing foresight on Luke's part and just how well he understands the nature of the conflict unfolding). Anakin actually understands that Luke is right, but he still is reluctant to admit, leading to ""If that is your destiny..."". Notice the choice of words and his tone: destiny in his understanding is an occurence that will happen, showing that he understood that Luke's judgement of the situation is probably right, but his tone is quiet, and his voice actually pitches up like when one is very emotional at the last syllable of the word ""destiny"", showing that he absolutely does not like the thought of having to kill Luke. 

Luke after hearing such a response understands that he is finally getting through to his father but that he may still lose, so his energy is finally raised and he drives the point home: Anakin does not want to see his family hurt, and that it will cause him even more pain, and thus Luke is asking him to search his feelings and to understand that he is not Vader, and that he can choose a different path. 

Anakin again admits completely that Luke is his son, signifying he has almost understood the truth of who he is, yet the reason for his Vader identity still remains (""it is too late for me"") and the fact that he calls for the guards to come back as well changing the subject back to the Emperor means that he understands that he has lost this fight, which is where Luke delivers an earth shattering line to Vader, one that the audiences may not always understand the true meaning of at first: ""then my father is truly dead"". By this line, Luke means that ""Vader"", the crafted personality is not his father, and that Anakin now is a complete stranger to him, and is not family. For Anakin, this is initially very heart-breaking - his son does not think of him as family, and basically admits that ""Vader"" is a complete stranger to him. 

After Luke is taken away, we see Vader slowly walk over and lean on the railing. This is a classical reaction to experiencing shock, and shows that the character is trying to realize what just happened or what they are told - and Anakin finally realizes something: that Vader is indeed not Luke's father, that Vader is not real but that he, Anakin, is the same person, stuck inside the same body only deluding himself to believe that he is somebody else when in reality it was him, Anakin, all along, and only now does he finally understand - Luke is right. ""Darth Vader"" always was Anakin Skywalker, but that Anakin Skywalker can himself choose not to be ""Darth Vader"". He only needs to just choose to do so (this is actually called back to in the Clone Wars, when Anakin and Obi-Wan argue during the Naboo Virus arc when Anakin says ""and sometimes all it requires is the will to jump""). 

On the Death Star, everything plays out just as Luke predicted: even despite Luke's conviction in that he is a Jedi, Luke does actually give in to the Dark Side anyway by the fact that he tries to kill the Emperor after the latter taunts him to. Vader, like with Mace Windu's situation, immediately jumps in to protect his master and ""friend"", even despite the fact that he knows the Emperor is a selfish scumbag, and throughout the fight is reassured that the Dark Side is right just by the fact Luke finally gave in and tried to kill Palpatine. However, Luke actually does not realize this and naively tries to turn Vader again in the wrong moment, which results in Vader demonstrating his superiority in combat through a move that Luke has never even seen before - a lightsaber throw, which understandably shocks him and, (ironically), takes away his mental and physical high ground.

We then see Luke hiding from Vader in the shadows, using Vader's trick from Bespin but understanding that he is basically screwed too just like back on Cloud City. Vader, knowing that Luke is shocked and is emotionally unbalanced now, finally gets into Luke's head and uncovers the truth that Leia is also his sister. Using that knowledge, Vader taunts Luke in that even though Luke can decide to not be a Sith like him, Leia still might. 

Luke, in ANGUISH, furiously attacks Vader in a fit of rage. By doing this, we see again that just like Anakin, Luke also cares about his family very much, and that in this emotional rage Luke forgets that Vader is still Anakin.  Anakin is absolutely shocked in that his son is just like him and it is this emotional surprise that results in Vader losing focus, leading to his saber arm finally being sliced off once more. 

Anakin is now at Luke's mercy, just like Dooku was at his. Luke knows that Vader is ""too dangerous to be left alive"", he believes that if he let's him live, Vader could corrupt his sister to become a Sith. Logically, Luke should kill Vader. 

However, just like with Anakin on the Invisible Hand, this does not sit right with Luke. He once more realizes that ""Vader"" is his father, and that his father, Anakin, is sitting at his mercy, with only a mask hiding the shock and fear on his face. And unlike Anakin, Luke cannot bring himself to kill his dad. Instead of focusing on the cruelty that he just unleashed on his dad, Luke decides to not kill Anakin, and understands that if he does, the Emperor will then truly win. 

In a true affirmation of what it is to be a Jedi, Luke throws away his lightsaber. Meaning that he refuses to enforce his power to stop an evil, even if it means the death of all. A Jedi uncompromised in his beliefs. 

To Anakin, this is an even greater shock. Even Mace Windu, a Jedi Master, discarded his belief when it was necessary. But Luke did not. And then something dawns on Anakin...

He gets up. This is where Anakin finally understands that Padme never betrayed him. Padme, like a true Jedi, instead decided to save him by sharing his pain that he suffered at Mustafar and dying as a result. He finally understands that Padme sacrificed herself to let him live so that he can in the end still become a better person, so that he can redeem himself. And Luke just demonstrated to him, right here and now, that even if you fall and commit terrible deeds, you can still choose to be better. And then, Vader hears his son scream ""Father, please!""

As we see, Vader is then glued to what is happening in front of him: his master, frustrated with Luke's defiance, decided to finally kill Luke Skywalker himself. Luke Skywalker - Padme's and Anakin's own son. 

Anakin, frantically looking at his master and his son, finally realizes the true horror of the situation in front of him. On one hand, his master, and his false ""Vader identity"" - on the other, Luke, close to death as a result of Palpatine's anger. If Anakin does not do something, Luke will definitely die. And then, once again, Vader will win, and this time Anakin might never again get the opportunity to redeem himself, falling back into the anguish that consumed and transformed him into Vader before. 

Anakin finally grasps the fact that he is Luke's dad once more. If it was Padme, she would not have hesitated to jump in between herself and Luke to try to save her son. But Anakin will let the Emperor kill his own son? 

""No. NOO!!!"" Anakin will not. He will not disappoint his wife, he won't betray Padme ever again, not even if she is dead, and especially not now by letting Sidious kill their son. He swiftly jumps in and picks up Sidious with the power of his mechanical body, now a blessing to his tired flesh, redirects the lightning to himself, and throws the Emperor down the nearest shaft. 

As his ""friend"" of a master falls down to his doom, Vader finally is at ease once more. Unlike his decisions to kill the Tuskens and the Jedi at the temple, this decision he felt good about. He stayed true to Padme and his son, his family. He really is Anakin, and he always was. His son, reciprocating his father's care for him, tries to help him. 

As Luke carries Anakin to a shuttle, Anakin understands that the lightning that he suffered is actually killing him now because it almost shut down the suit. He is finding it even harder to breathe, and realizing he may soon die, decides to ask his son to take off his mask, so that he may finally see Luke's face with his own eyes, without looking from the confines of a mask. Luke protests: he wants to save his dad. But Anakin reassures him: ""You already have"". Luke and Leia both were the reason why Padme was even able to call on the Force to save him, and in this moment he is alluding to that, even though Luke does not yet realize it himself. Luke is now confused and saddened, and Anakin tries to lift his son's spirit up one last time: he tells him that Luke was right all along, and that he should tell his sister too, that he was right...

Anakin is finally free of the prison of his emotions. His decision to stay true to his family, his wants to be a good person, his decision to at least to try to redeem himself in the end makes him even stronger in death than he was in life. His redeeming action left a great echo in the Force. This show of emotional fortitude, of redemption, of to never give up hope even when all is lost, and to at least try to give hope and reassurance to others even in the darkest of times, is what allows Anakin to become a Force Ghost. 

At last, Anakin gets to see the fruits of Padme's labor: all the people he called ""rebels"" and ""traitors"", all the people he would have considered ""separatists"" , are now dancing. Like him, they are also finally free. Anakin realizes he does indeed have more common with them than he thought. And then Luke catches a glimpse of him, and Anakin Skywalker realizes that his son can see him. Revealing himself to Luke, he momentarily looks to his old friend Obi-Wan, who, just like before, during the Clone Wars, looks at him trying to show disapproval but ends up with a cringing at Anakin's awkward moment anyway. As Anakin realizes he is back once more with his long time friends, he looks away from the ground and up to a starry sky, wishing for good luck to the latest addition to the Jedi Order and for a happy future to every one involved, one full of hope... 

Thus ends the tale of Anakin Skywalker, the tale of a brave Jedi Knight whose story likely invigorated the hopes of countless Jedi across the vast galaxy to always rise up to try to be good... well, not really since Lord JJ Abrams completely forgot about him until the last movie of the Sequels, and even then he barely put him in. 

On a personal note,

Disney, you can go...

Sorry, was about to lose it there. 

And additionally,

Good job Hayden Christensen and Sebastian Shaw! I will always love you guys for playing my favorite character of Star Wars! And of course, thanks to George Lucas: without your want to tell the story of Anakin, Luke, Padme, Obi-Wan and Leia, my childhood would have never been the same.


Post Submission Addendum (With even more personal feelings involved, so be warned):

The point is, while people see Darth Vader as a cold person, and like his armor, appearance, and mannerisms, him being heartless is the furthest from the truth. Much of the audiences, strangely enough, tend to focus on the things that make him look as the coolest, classiest villain (AKA the metaphorical mask that Vader made for himself) rather than the true uniqueness of the character - the fact that the character takes too many things to heart, including family. But when Lucas tried to directly portray Anakin's emotional vulnerability in the Prequels, people got upset that their classy villain ""has been ruined"" and turns out ""he was a whiny teenager"" - when it is just them being plain wrong about the character all along. And then some of those people lashed out at the actors while taking it personally, which is monstrous in its own right too...

No, Lucas never ""ruined"" Star Wars, and I stand by that statement. If anything, he got inspired by the fact people liked his work and stories, and decided to press on and tell us more about Anakin's sad story. But with the Prequels, I think he finally got the unfortunate reality - people completely missed the point of his Original Films. And completely missed what made Darth Vader... well, Anakin Skywalker.

The truth is, of all the characters in the Star Wars Original films, Vader is (and always was) emotionally the weakest one - so things like family become a duel edged sword for him. Even in A New Hope, we see Vader quickly lash out at those who ""cross"" him. It's not cool, it's a sign of taking things too personally and not being able to stomach criticism, no matter how pointless it is. Vader was emotionally unhealthy, is emotionally unhealthy, and should always be portrayed as an emotionally unhealthy character. 

The sad thing about Anakin is that he is very talented. He was extremely curious about the world around him, eager to do so for the good of others, and as such, his curiosity rewarded him with great skill and talent, a gift only strengthened by his connection to the Force.  However, the one thing he could never explain is his own emotions - another one of the reasons why he was so drawn to Padme, whose confidence meant to him that she was sure in herself and her own emotions, so maybe she can help him with his?

This emotional instability is what drew my teenage self to Anakin. I also had a lot of trouble explaining my emotions - I always seemed to have an easier time explaining things, understanding that which other people found confusing. Being born in Russia, I placed a lot of importance on cold manners and care for family - so I lashed out a lot on those who ""crossed"" me. So initially, I was drawn to Vader - he was cold and calculating, but he cared for his family.

However, as I rewatched the prequels, and got taken away with Anakin'a deep love for Padme, I was perplexed by Hayden's portrayal of Anakin - a whiny, arrogant, and confused teenager. Then I took a look at myself in the mirror - a whiny, confused, and cold-blooded teenager, and I saw in myself the very traits I appeared to hate. It's only then that I understood the true brilliance of Hayden's acting (who actually portrayed other emotionally unstable characters too). And then I understood why I always seemed to like Anakin far more than any other SW character - we were very similar. 

To me, Anakin's story is a cautionary tale of what happens when you are not taking care of your own emotions. It is important to understand why you feel the way you do, so that you can control of your own feelings and emotions and be more like Anakin's son, Luke Skywalker, who ultimately did learn to do just that.

I love Anakin Skywalker, and I always will. I am glad to have been born in the time period that I was, just so that I could see his full story. I swear when I die, I will be buried with all the Prequel and OG Trilogy films."
354,1635555925.0,StarWarsTheories,"Did KOTOR II try to clear up plot points of Revenge of the Sith? - Now, I might be going completely mad here, but if you know me, you are also likely aware that I believe in this the theory that Padme died because of the strong affinity of her children, which permitted her to connect with Anakin through the Force and take the brunt of the damage he took on Mustafar thus allowing him to live. The full theory is here: https://www.reddit.com/r/StarWarsTheories/comments/pstbgp/theory_padmes_force_sensitivity_is_the_reason/?utm_medium=android_app&utm_source=share

Anyway, the inspiration for that theory for me came from KOTOR II, in which Kreia and Meetra Surik develop an unusually strong force bond through which if one gets hurt, then the other is hurt too. Personally, it seems very similar to what happened to Padme and Anakin, and the fact that the game has released in 2004, right in the middle of the production of Revenge of the Sith, does not help to ease suspicions. Do you guys suspect that alongside reading all the Star Wars Expanded Universe novels,  Chris Avellone and whoever else helped write the story might have also consulted with Lucas or visited the set for the film for inspiration about the potential story of KOTOR II and how it could connect to Revenge of the Sith?? I would love to hear what you guys think about this, including any contradictions or other affirming details."

In this case, the infatuation with Anakin and the failure to deal with Luke, Rey, even Kylo, seems inefficient and counter-productive, as well as his decision to build the entire fleet of the NIO undercove, since he had already established his prowess at deception with the clones. If he actually understood the climate of the universe from a conflict  perspective, then Vader would have been installed to force change from the stagnation of the Jedi Order. Palpatine would have expected that he would eventually be overthrown, and so left Luke unimpeded. Snoke, Rey, the whole thing would have been to keep the tempo of unimportant conflict, to keep the move towards progressively more sociologically beneficial world orders. Having nominally evil rulers in such cases would be an advantage - you can shape their new regimes from the shadows, while still encouraging their overthrow, and shape not each culture, but the entire history of the galaxy. However, if he employed a functionalist perspective, this wouldn't really be the case, but this still doesn't explain the rest of his actions."
357,1635392496.0,StarWarsTheories,"[Part 3] Anakin's Mental Struggles, and Padme's death. Episodes III-IV-V - This is a continuation to my two previous theories detailing Anakin Skywalker emotional struggles. You don't have to read them I think to understand this one, but you still should. 

Also, this theory will be covering gruesome topics, which involve thoughts of self-harm. If you struggle with such topics, please don't be like Anakin, and reach out to somebody who can help you. 

Now let's move on to the story. 

Anakin's experience on Mustafar is probably the most unimaginable experience that any one of us (except for other burn victims). From what I am finding, Anakin possibly received fourth degree burns - this is when the burns go through underlying skin layers, the underlying tissue as well as the deeper tissue, with the possibility of reaching muscle and bone. At this point, Anakin's burns are so bad that he might have felt numb in a few areas - indicating that the fire has destroyed his nerve endings. And he is still feeling horrendous pain from quite literally everywhere else on his body, too. Not to even mentioned he lost the rest of his limbs as well. The pain was so bad that Anakin passes out just as Palpatine had arrived. 

For many people, what Anakin has suffered would quite literally mean death. However, according to my first theory ever posted on this subreddit, I believe that Padme has reached out to Anakin via the Force Sensitivity of the infant Luke and Leia inside her, and is at that moment taking the brunt of the pain - essentially buying time for Palpatine to get Anakin to the medical facility on Coruscant, at the cost of her own life. Something that Anakin still can't sense as he is unconscious. 

Of course, during the operation Anakin wakes up, however now his pain is becoming easened as he is being placed in his suit - which finally gave him clarity on what he had done, as well as the ability to feel Padme taking the brunt of the pain. Unfortunately, the pain she absorbed for him is slowly killing her, something that Anakin feels, however he can also feel that at that moment she was also experiencing additional stress (her giving birth to Luke and Leia). And when he feels that she is close to death, he calls to her through telepathy ""Padme!!"" (the one that people started to notice right around when the helmet is put on Vader). 

Anakin, very startled, confused, and uncomfortable, however now finally free of most of the pain of the burns thanks to the medical treatment, finally gets to talk to his master - and naturally, he asks Palpatine where is Padme and if she is safe, as he had felt that she was in additional pain and was worried from it that she was in danger. 

Palpatine, who has been in the facility during the operation and has picked up on the unusual circumstance of Anakin's survival as well as a strong presence of the Force going from him to somewhere else due to his knowledge of the Force as well as it's abrupt end, now gets the confirmation through Vader's question. Which is when he lays out what the abruptly end of the Force connection likely meant - Padme is dead. 

Palpatine saying what he did (""In your anger, you killed her"") basically meant that Anakin's anger at Kenobi led to his defeat at Mustafar, and the burns suffered as a result killed her. Which is when Anakin goes back into anguish - completely on disbelief, he tries again at rationalizing what happened but to no avail as he knows it is true, which is when his anguish once more completely takes over. He breaks his chains, and with a loud (and cheesy) ""Noooo!!"" steps out once again. 


Of course, Anakin likely was deep in thought soon after rather experience. His weakened mental state encouraged to accept the idea that he was not himself when he did what he did - ""I killed her, I didn't think about anyone else. But I loved her - no, I hadn't. Anakin did. I have betrayed her, and killed her. How can I be Anakin? Anakin was supposed to be selfless. He would never have given up. I am a perversion of what Anakin is - I am a selfish and uncaring bastard. I am Darth Vader. I am worthless, and I don't deserve Padme's love. She should have let me die. Obi-Wan should have killed me. My greed, I killed his favorite student, no, his brother, after all."" This is likely when Palpatine comes in, notices his weakened state, and starts to try to encourage him as he still needs Anakin to be pawn, as best as a Sith knows how to - by using his previous desire as Anakin to ensure to order. And Anakin's thoughts about order and power still didn't change, so he naturally accepts. 

With bringing order to the galaxy being Anakin's only remaining goal in life, he completely devotes himself to that task, plunging into it without any regard for himself, and now fueled by internal rhetoric of ""what Darth Vader is"" as well as Palpatine's teachings, this time without regard for others. Anakin completely engulfed in the many tasks to enforce the Galactic Empire's supremacy, finds that these tasks help him to keep his mind of off his self-depreciating thoughts, which only makes him even more fanatical to his cause. 

Obviously, Darth Vader is not a different personality -  it's the same person, still in the same body, just going through a significant and traumatic change in his life. As we the audience can still see in Rogue One (despite Rogue One not being made by Lucas, it still picks up on this character trait relatively well) and Episode 5 Anakin's love of humor still sneaks through - ""Be careful not to choke on your aspirations, director"" and ""apology accepted, Captain Needa"", respectively. So Anakin is always still inside the person now known to the rest of the galaxy as Vader, even if Vader denies it vehemently. 

Note: Since Episode 4 was the first Star Wars movie released, I at this point think this movie developed the least on Anakin as it was not meant to do so at all - Anakin was only really a reason for Luke's Force sensitivity, for why Luke is special. Vader was meant to be a cool yet very dangerous secondary antagonist and assistant to the main antagonist of this film, Grand Moff Tarkin. However, Vader's popularity likely propelled Lucas to think on his backstory far more, leading to the films we have now, where the former versions of Anakin and Vader have merged. 

Vader's encounter in Episode 4 is... well, a little awkward, as Vader likely never expected to see Obi-Wan again. Trying to assert dominance and to intimidate Kenobi, Anakin tells him that he is now the master, not Obi-Wan. Obi-Wan, seeming quite unfazed, retorts. Vader, furious that Obi-Wan still underestimates him, goes back in to clash with him. Upon Obi-Wan's death, he is obviously quite surprised when his former master's body just disappears, causing him a great many questions to ponder even after the Millennium Falcon's escape. 

Palpatine's reveal that Luke is technically his son (notice how Palpatine says ""the offspring of Anakin Skywalker"", Vader likely told him how he felt about himself some time after the medical procedure) naturally answered the question that Padme had indeed successfully given birth to Luke, and that likely the pain he felt her going through was the pain of childbirth.

Vader however was still on the middle of a mission to capture the Millennium Falcon. After issuing a bounty contract to find the ship, Vader hopes find the two rebels, realizing that Han Solo and Princess Leia Organa likely developed a bond with Luke as a result of their escape from the Death Star. With this bond, Vader hopes to lure Skywalker out, and to see what sort of stuff his son is made of. 

The planet Bespin turns out to be perfect for Vader's plan - the urban environment made it easy for him to hide the arrival of his troops in the numerous halls of the buildings, and the fact that it had cryofreezing chambers meant that Luke could be subdued in case things went awry. Succesfully testing out the chambers on Solo, Vaders now simply waits for Luke to come to the chambers.

Luke coming to face Vader, and to stare at him right in his eyes with no fear was already a good sign for Darth Vader. Luke was stoic - just like Anakin used to be. 

Throughout the fight, Vader overpowers Luke easily despite the fact that he was not trying to kill him. Clearly, this is a disappointment to Vader as it meant Luke did not practice with the lightsaber too much. Vader, thinking this is everything he needs to know, knocks Luke into the chamber and begins the freezing process. So of course when he finds out Luke has gotten out of the chamber and is now holding onto the pipes to try and hide stuns him, possibly even giving a moment of fatherly pride (""that's MY kid, alright!""). Just notice the delivery of ""Impressive...Most impressive"". 

Now knowing that Luke definitely practiced his Force powers (through Yoda), he decides to test how well he can use them. First, he decides to test out Luke's telekinetic powers, which does not go to plan: Luke slashes at the objects thrown rather than pushing them away through the Force. Left rather unimpressed, Vader then hides, and decides to see how well Luke can sense the environment around him - something that Luke can do ok at best, as he does respond in time to Vader's attack but did not notice him before the attack. Trapping Luke on the balcony, Vader decides its enough and tells Luke to stop fighting, something that Luke at first resists, not realizing the true nature of their fight. Vader, getting fed up, is then suddenly brought out of his ""testing mode"" by Luke's successful blow to his shoulder and remembers that Luke still thinks this is a life or death fight, and rapidly subdues his son by the same trick he did to Dooku - cutting off his hand. 

Vader's offer to his son tells us two things: Vader still wants to bring order: ""with our combined strength, we can end this destructive conflict and bring order to the galaxy"", but he has figured out Palpatine's true, greedy motivations for keeping him around. ""You can destroy the Emperor"", ""we can rule the galaxy as father and son"" - obviously sentiments Palpy wouldn't like too much. 

Luke, however, decides to YOLO it and drops down the shaft. Vader later figures out he is alive, as he successfully manages to reach out him through telepathy when seeing the Millennium Falcon.

Okay so we know from the Han Solo movie, Solo, that Darth Maul is alive at the beginning of the New Empire. And at the end of the animated series, the clone wars, darth maul runs multiple crime syndicate groups and, escapes alone in a ship and flies off. Between then and his death in Star Wars rebels; (this show tales place between order 66 and a new hope, just as Han Solo is) this gives him a good amount of time, at least 16-18 years assuming Luke’s age in a new hope) if he were to have trained an apprentice like he did his brother savage then they could have been able to keep it a secret from palpatine until him and Vader died. This would also allow for the idea of the second generation of the main characters to fit in more. And this would have given them the opportunity to have a hint of where Rey actually comes from instead of saying palpatine had offspring, leading to another trilogy about her parents and her life leading up to episode 7. Therefore recreating another set of prequels that take place during the start of the rebellion. 

It would make the entire Star Wars universe connect perfectly while keeping the prophecy of anakin intact."
363,1634168656.0,StarWarsTheories,"[Part 2] Anakin and Padme's Conflicts explained??? - This is a continuation of a previous post that I made if the same name. If you want to read Part 1, here's the link: https://www.reddit.com/r/StarWarsTheories/comments/q74z40/theory_anakin_and_padmes_conflicts_explained/?utm_medium=android_app&utm_source=share

Now, where was I? Ah yes, we're close to the start of Revenge of the Sith: by the time of this movie, Anakin already has been constantly using forceful and heavy handed tactics (Not too dissimilar to what he does later as Vader) on people like Admiral Trench and Asajj Ventress in order to get information that he wanted. The interrogation of Asajj is particularly important to analyze because it involved somebody that Anakin also considered to be ""sort of"" his family: Ahsoka Tano. The ironic nature of the Jedi to be fair at all times and to not take sides bites them in the rear when they are presented with seemingly overwhelming ""evidence"" that tried to prove that Ahsoka was the true criminal all along, they sided it with it. Of the Jedi only Anakin openly let her know that he was on her side all along (as him being her mentor resulted in him thinking of her almost as a family member, as like a little sister), and this is likely the point when Anakin's faith in the Jedi Code starts to shatter as he realizes that it is incompatible with the familial kind of life he naturally leans to. 

The ""interrogation"" of Admiral Trench (let's be honest it was actually torture) proves that Anakin is really losing the fight to be a proper Jedi, as he still relies on exerting his power upon others to get the results he wants, which in this case again is information. Unfortunately for the Jedi Council, Anakin's closed nature still keeps them from being able to ""help"" him with overcoming to what they would have seen as flaws in an emotionally based marriage as well as using power and intimidation to achieve results (let's remember a part of the Clovis arc where Anakin tries to deny that he has any romantic feeling about Padme from Obi-Wan, and the Season 7 moment with Rex in which Obi-Wan clearly knows about it but Anakin still refuses to open up). With the unwillingness to turn to the Council, the potential fear of consequences from opening up to Obi-Wan as seen in Episode 2, and Ahsoka/Rex not being present to help him advise on moral dilemmas, Anakin is only able to turn to Palpatine or Padme for help. 

The true genius of Palpatine plan to convert Anakin is that he is already using any sort of preconceived notions or feelings that Anakin already has, and developing them further (like in the Rako Hardeen arc, or in RotS when he says that he thinks the Jedi don't trust him) as if coming from sympathy. Palpatine doesn't really plant the seeds of the Dark Side so much as rather watering them AKA giving substance to his darker, forceful nature, his doubts, his fears, his suspicions, and making them so dominant within Anakin that he will just naturally start to agree with Sith philosophy about power. 
The death of Dooku ultimately is the point of no return. Palpatine encouraging Anakin to kill Dooku is once more telling Anakin that using power to prevent more death is key to ending conflict, even if it is completely unethical and can be avoided. 

This is where another ""theory"" comes into play: I am absolutely sure that Palpatine intended for the Council to arrive (""must I say you are here sooner than EXPECTED"" he could be saying that they might have consulted him after they heard the news but he could be playing words here too, it's Sidious) and ensure that Windu defeated him so that Anakin could see that even Jedi Masters, who are supposed to embody the Jedi Code, are not above using power unethically for the greater good. 

Obviously, Anakin thinking of Palpatine as a mentor and a father like figure, Anakin naturally jumps on to protect someone who he viewed as trying to help him be on the right path against somebody that he saw as a lying, slimy hypocrite in Mace Windu (Despite the fact that Windu was really only concerned by Anakin's closed, dark, power exerting nature that other Jedi did not see or like Obi-Wan ignored, which is why he denied him the rank of Master and did not trust him as much, as he thought Skywalker needed more time and training to process everything he felt and to come to the Jedi for help. This hardly seems like hatred for Anakin, as it's a normal thing a teacher would say). To Anakin, Windu not only lied about the death of his Master but also helped Obi-Wan to cover this up from Anakin, and also scolded Anakin for not being ""Jedi"" enough despite breaking the Jedi Code. 

Upon Darth Sidious giving Anakin the title of Darth Vader, Anakin essentially discarded the Jedi doctrine completely and fully began to view the Jedi Order as a corruption that will only make the Republic weaker than what it needs to be to overcome any threats to it present and future. While he was still conflicted about whether what he was going to do was really right, (The Jedi Purge), his extremely strong and potent emotions about saving Padme from death and sparing the Republic of the hypocrisies of the Jedi Council (As demonstrated in Mace Windu) kept him from doubting what he was doing. 

The slaughter of the Separatist Council, while being a satisfying scene to almost anybody who hated Nute Gunray and Poggle the Lesser, also served as a scene to show that Anakin has completely lost it: not only is he willing to enforce his definition of order through deadly means, his deep hatred about the ways of the Jedi Order and the want to save his family and avoid the anguish he felt at the death of his mother prevent him from rationalizing anything against what he is doing. Essentially, this the true demonstration of Lord Vader as a Sith - engulfed in selfishness and hatred, unable to empathize with anyone else besides himself and his master, and just to add a cherry on top, a killer that takes life without feeling that there was any better way than slaughter.

To Padme, all of this is a horrific betrayal to her: he was still an ally to her in protecting the ideals of the Republic as a Jedi. A stoic, caring, and passionate Jedi at that, someone who really did try to make this secret marriage actually feel like a marriage and always stayed fiercely loyal to her, even when it did not benefit her political goals. 

However now he is essentially backstabbing her: he not only killed the Jedi (Whom she saw as her allies, unlike Bail Organa and other senators), but his fall also made it clear to her that he was more on agreeable with Palpatine's political ideals (Which she was shown to abhor) rather than her own. This is probably why she did not believe at first when Obi-Wan told her about what Anakin did: it almost sounded like something out of her nightmares rather than reality. Of course, going to Mustafar only broke Padme to the point where she stops caring about the Republic and to try to get Anakin with her to raise her child, the last thing Padme still has that she now cares for other than the Republic (That Palpatine now stole from her) and Anakin himself (To her on the verge of being taken from her). 

To Vader, all of Padme's talk about how truly demented all of what he did is simply brushed off: his hatred at the Jedi like Obi-Wan as well as justification for his actions being worth it to save Padme and bring order to the galaxy naturally also pushed him to disregard her concerns. Remember, he really liked her in the first place because of how Jedi-like she was - and now that his want to be a Jedi is gone, so is the admiration of the Jedi-like qualities in Padme. 

Obi-Wan's arrival only infuriates Anakin more to the point where he actually believes she brought him here to kill him, and that she was the one who betrayed him, when it is really he who betrayed her. Anakin's now almost incoherent talk about the lies of the Jedi (clearly showing to us that he has gone nuts, likely strengthened by sleep deprivation from the nightmares) only convinces Obi-Wan to do what Yoda told him he must do: to put down Anakin once and for all. Of course, Obi-Wan is no Mace Windu, and he is simply unable to kill someone that he really loved and cared for just like that: so instead he just leaves him, like a coward, ashamed of what he had done, taking Anakin's lightsaber as a trophy to remember his student by, all the while hoping that what he did was right and hoping that Anakin did not suffer too much before his death. 

Of course, we know otherwise. 

I will cover Anakin's horrific and tormented life inside the suit in Part 3."
364,1634105373.0,StarWarsTheories,"Theory: Anakin and Padme's conflicts ""explained""? - Ok, so now that I am starting to rewatch a lot of the footage from Attack of the Clones and the Phantom Menace, I am once again starting to try to piece together how Anakin felt at different points in his life.  This is obviously going to be a long one since I am quite literally trying to explain en entire guy's life and rationalizations, so please stay with me!

Let's start with first thing off: Anakin is born on Tatooine to single mother. Why is this important to who Anakin is? Number one: Anakin being born on Tattoone in an unfriendly environment, being a slave born go a single mother naturally he would tend to go to her for any sort of help he needs instead of going to others, and with how kind and nurturing Anakin's mother is he would quickly develop the idea that families is the most important thing one can have, and in the world with few other adults that he can trust, she would naturally become his go to mentor. (This is also a trend in many third world countries like the ones in Africa in which there is a great emphasis on family) 

Another thing that Anakin likely learned due to being a Tatooine native is that power is indeed quite an important tool to have at your disposal if you want things to go how you want them to. After all, I believe it is quite likely that he heard stories of travelers being attacked and fighting off Tusken war parties, and likely got the message that they stayed alive because they were smarter AND stronger than the Tuskens, and as such Anakin likely tried to always appear to be powerful as a way to get his way with anyone except his mom: when Greedo accused Anakin of cheating at the podracing event, Anakim almost immediately turned to fists to try to defend his boyish sense of ""honor"". Oh, and let's not forget that were Hutts and slave owners on Tattooine who exerted their own power. 

We can then see this philosophy of power manifested later, when Anakin is in front of the Jedi Council and is being evaluated. Rather than admitting that he is indeed feeling sad about his mother, Anakin instead tries to cover it up, and deflect it back on the Jedi Council by saying ""What's that got to do with anything?"", which obviously to the Council meant that he was not that open to having his mind changed (Which is where their real concerns were about Anakin: since his experiences formulated his opinions so strongly, it now seemed unlikely that he can be persuaded in the Jedi way of thinking). 

Skip forward towards Attack of the Clones, and an almost out of the teenage years Anakin. While he is a Jedi Padawan now,, there are several indications that he still believes in that power is quite important to life; when Obi-Wan tries to scold Anakin about him promising to find out who tried to assassinate Padme, Anakin instead defiantly bites back at him by attempting to rationalize his promise as being in the good of protecting Senator Amidala which leads to Obi-Wan to get Anakin to get back in order, which he eventually does by wearing him out through repeating what he said before. The rationalization that Anakin tries here is really an evolved version of him trying to defend himself and his actions (AKA his ""honor""), not realizing immediately that this is not exactly the time to do so in front of everyone else. When Obi-Wan is right, he does however admit he is wrong by lowering his head in a way that is a classic sign of submission. Which leads to my next point...

The core premise for Anakin in AotC is the conflict between his now subconscious tendencies towards using power to get what you want as well as family being quite important that he acquired from Tattooine and his now conscious beliefs about the Jedi ideals and ways (How Jedi must be patient, fair to all without preferential treatment, and without using force and try to seek other ways to resolve problems). What we see is that Anakin really does want to believe in what the Jedi teach him. However, the death of his mother rails those the ideals against each other: on one side, he does feel great anguish at not being able to protect his mother, someone he felt he owed a great deal to (in which his feelings guided him to ""rightfully"" punish the Tuskens in an eye for an eye sort of policy very reminiscent of third world countries), while on the other side he felt deeply upset at his own actions that he saw as un-Jedi. In the end, Anakin wants to be a Jedi but his closed nature and insufficient action due to feeling helpless works against him. 

This is where Padme comes in, and brings in many wrinkles. In a way, Anakin almost admires her, and holds her up on a pedestal: her devotion to the people of Naboo (almost like a family) is almost like that of his to his mother, and her work as a senator as well as her empathetic nature naturally makes her a great negotiator as well as a fairly decent politician. Add to that the fact that she is beautiful, and you can see why he would ""fall for her"" (Essentially get his lust mixed up with love in a common teenage manner). 

Upon his mother's death, Padme tries to understand why Anakin did what he did, and attempts to comfort him almost like his mother would, which would lead him to accept her as a family. 

This is where essentially Padme starts to actually take the driver's seat, rather than Anakin. Knowing how Anakin will lose himself to anguish if Kenobi (who she assumes to be almost like a father figure to Anakin) dies as well as not willing to leave an ally behind, she goes to rescue the trapped Jedi Master. Notice how Anakin at first tries to stop her (he is trying to make up for his un-Jedi behavior earlier by following the Council's order) before deciding to go with her. 

Now to Geonosis and the whole marriage thing. I actually feel that this was rather Padme's idea rather than Anakin. When the two are ridden put to be put on the Petranaki Arena poles, she is the first one to say that she loves him, to Anakin's surprise (he gave up on that after she rejected him on Naboo during their little night out as is shown by his line ""I thought we decided to not fall in love""). It is confusing, but I suspect that Padme grew to say that she loved him because she liked just how protective he was of those he considered family (his mother, Obi-Wan, and now her), which likely rung close to home with her mission of defending her people that she alsp considers an extended family. Add to that she likely considers Anakin to be cute, wants him to help him be a better Jedi, and voila, she tells him that she loves him as a final confession before what she assumed was their imminent death (This is really oversimplified I guess). After Geonosis Padme drives home that they should get married likely to fot Naboo traditions and to solidify their status as lovers, Anakin accepts, and we get the marriage scene at the end of AotC. 


Come the Clone Wars, and we once again see Anakin's Jedi ideals fight against his subconscious nature to use power. A marvelous demonstration of this is is Rako Hardeen arc, in which Anakin is led to believe that Obi-Wan is dead and this time, once again, Anakin loses himself once more in a now far more sinister anguish. One of my favorite scenes is when Anakin just straight up ignites his lightsaber before even starting to speak to anyone in a cantina in order to make his intentions clear (threatening with power), which almost leads him to kill Obi-Wan. 

And then there is the Clovis arc, in which Anakin becomes so unwilling and fearful of his wife in dying (Remember anguish?) due to Clovis's shenanigans that he almost kills Clovis out of fury. He only realizes that what he is doing is wrong only after he already delivers most of the damage. Hence a foreshadow of the fear to come in Revenge of the Sith.

I am greatly tired right now, and will leave off here. I will try to post a part two sometime later, after I got my sleep. Good night!

Ok so I rewatched clone wars again recently and one episode caught my eye. Episode 21 season 2. (R2 come home) to sum it up Anakin and mace are trapped on a crashed star destroyer  on the planet Vanqor. R2 is sent to get help. Eventually R2 crashes Anakin’s star fighter and  takes maces. This caught my eye because at the start of Jedi fallen order. Cal and Prauf find a Jedi star fighter crashed on a crashed star destroyer.I think that’s the same star destroyer and anakins ship. Everything matches up. The only thing that can prove my theory wrong that I know of is well “bracca and Vanqor is a different planet dummy”. Well Bracca is a recycling landfill planet. Well I think the ship was taken there as the game started so it could be recycled. Plz help me I’m very curious to see what y’all thank. Thank you."

He further imprints Mando with paternal feelings toward Grogu, causing Mando to break with the Guild, leave the Covert, etc. Their relationship evolves somewhat naturally over time, but it was Grogu that gave him the kick start.  Grogu ""asked"" him to help the villagers against the bandits. He ""asked"" him to help the Frog lady (he was hungry for her eggs). He ""asked"" him to help find another Jedi. A related question/answer: How did Grogu get to the outpost with all the Nikto guards in the first place? He mind-tricked their leader into protecting him. He looks like a baby, but he managed to survive the purge just fine. There has to be some way he did this. Cute only works so much."
370,1632558814.0,StarWarsTheories,"Only a sith deals in absolutes- theoretical explanation - I've been thinking on Old Bens lines. So, maybe Obi Wan Kenobi didn't mean absolute as in all absolutes, like how yodas teachings were absolute, etc. Maybe he meant that the future, as seen even through The Force was not absolute. As Yoda said, ''Always in motion is the future'', and ''Impossible to see, the future is''. So, when Anakin turned to dark side, a desperate attempt to save her who he loved out of many reasons, he did it thinking that the future, as he had been shown it through The Force, was inevitable, ABSOLUTE.  So, any feedback here?"
371,1632540464.0,StarWarsTheories,"Bendu and the Mortis gods theory. - I have been rewatching the clone wars, and I got to the Mortis gods arc, and it got me thinking.

So, I think it's fairly safe to say that there is some sort of connection between the Bendu and the Mortis gods. They both have an incredible and unique connection to the force, they can appear in different forms, and they don't seem to be bound to space or time.

So, what exactly is the connection? Well, the reason that the the Father wanted Anakin to come there in the first place was to take his place, and keep the balance of the force. But when the daughter dies, and the father morns, the son seems to take over. Many think that is why the empire is during that time, because the dark side is trying to balance out the years of light. 

So, here is where the theory comes in. What if instead of Anakin, the Bendu took the father's place? Both of them claim to be neither light nor dark, Sith nor Jedi, and they are both totally powerful. 

When Thrawn gets the better of Bendu, and he is about to kill him, Bendu just disappears. But back at the Mortis planet the Father talks about how the three of them saw fit to ""leave the temporal plain"" to try to maintain balance. 

What if, when the Bendu disappears, he too leaves the temporal plain, and goes to try to balance out the Son on the planet Mortis. Clearly, the Son has had a lot more experience, and is probably stronger than the Bendu, so the Bendu is not able to beat him outright, but when Luke, the Chosen One's son, who some claim to be the true Chosen One, kills Darth Vader, one of the most powerful dark side users of all time, it is enough for the Bendu to at least make temporary balance. 

Just something to think about, I really do think there is some kinda connection between the Mortis gods and the Bendu, but let me know what you guys think. Maybe the Bendu is just a different form of the Father himself? I don't know, but it's fun to think about."
372,1632261852.0,StarWarsTheories,"Theory: Padme's Force Sensitivity is the reason Anakin lives to serve the Emperor? - So while I was watching the scene where Anakin and Padme stare at each other across Coruscant, a weird thought came into my head; somehow, Natalie Portman's acting (at that moment) didn't seem like she was gazing off, wondering: her eyes were wide open, almost as if she had a realization or something. Then I thought it was strange of how Anakin (Or Lord Vader, now) seems to ""shout"" (Telepathy?) ""PADME!!!"" when his Vader helmet is put on. Somehow, I don't think the two are just there to symbolize something; I think there is somehow a Force Bond between the two. And no, I heard the Padme force heal thing, this is not what I am trying to prove.

Let me explain some stuff first. You might ask: How could Padme have a Force Bond with Anakin? How could she feel what he felt? Well, since her two newborns (Luke and Leia) have the Force potential of their father, they also have a huge amount of midichlorians - but how did they get them? I think the answer is that the midichlorians first gather inside the mother's blood, to then be supplied (Like other nutrients) to the baby. While for a normal mother something like this would do nothing to increase their connection with the Force for a time being, for Padme this might be different - she is carrying two of the potentially most powerful beings in the universe. 

So that is why I suspect she could use the Force (Albeit temporarily, until Luke and Leia are born and the midichlorians subside). I think there is actually some concept art that was made by artists working for Lucasfilm of how Padme is seeing visions and is trying to get Yoda's help too, if you need some more evidence to assure yourself. 

Now let's analyze the scene where Padme and Anakin look at each other across Coruscant: notice who stands up first - it's Padme. She walks up to the window, and stares out of it to the Jedi Temple (Similarly to how Vader communicated with Luke at the end of Episode V). She doesn't speak, but her eyes are wide open, which I think might mean she can sense or be reaching out to somebody on instinct on that direction, and that somebody is Anakin, the closest person to her and a powerful Force user. Notice how it's after that is when we see Anakin stand up, and walk to his window too, coincidentally looking in her direction, almost as if reacting. Then we see Padme, with eyes wide open, still looking. We then go back to Anakin who starts to gulp/get nervous, clearly stressed. Soon after which we go back to Padme, who looks down (Another suspicious move, as she was almost trying to think over what just happened). We then cut to Anakin, who begins to shed tears. 

 I think what happened is that Padme actually just instinctively connected (with the Force) to Anakin, something that he could subconsciously feel, but his torn mind is on the Palpatine dilemma, thus clouding his ability to sense anyone else - hence the ""Dark Side"" clouding his vision. 

Here is most important part of my theory: Padme didn't actually heal Anakin - rather, she actually took the brunt of the lava burn pain through the already established bond, which is how Anakin is capable of resisting death long enough for the suit to be put on him. This pain is also what ends up killing Padme, as while she is strong willed, as Anakin implies in Episode II, she is not trained to use the Force to resist it. 

Now about the heartbeats. I suspect that the heartbeat that we hear stopping isn't Anakin's - It's Padme's, and the reason why we can hear it beating is because that's what Anakin is feeling - implying he can actually feel her via the Force now. That's why he shouts, not whispers, ""PADME!!!"" right before he dons the mask, as he can feel her life slipping. Which is why after Palpy responds to his question, Vader goes berserk and screams ""SHE WAS ALIVE, I FELT IT!"". 

You may ask: Why does Padme not die instantly if she took the brunt of the pain, and why does she live long enough to say Anakin can be redeemed after her heartbeat stops? Number 1: the lava burn pain is periodical rather than instant, and Number 2: people's bodies still function for 4-6 minutes after the heart stops beating (Quick search up, please leave a reply if you know any more). 

So if this is the case, it also explains Palpatine's words: ""In your anger, you killed her"" is just an oversimplification of ""In your anger for the Jedi, you made a horrific blunder of literally burning alive while she was connected to you through the Force, the damage of which also killed her"". It also explains Vader's last line to Luke after the latter states that he wants to save him: ""You already have"". Because then Luke, Leia, and Padme already have saved him before, so that he could actually redeem himself now. 

So this is what I think actually happened. Please do feel to respond to this, I would love to try to explain some more of this as this could be the actual answer  (I think, anyway). May the Force be with you!

Note: I wrote this while in a rush, so I do keep editing the wording and grammar all the time, whenever I see that it might not make sense. Sorry!"
373,1632103220.0,StarWarsTheories,"What If: The New Republic turned Evil -  While I ultimately like the direction Lucasfilms took Star Wars: The Force Awakens, I can’t help but wish they had gone in a different direction, namely in the villain department. The return of the imperial army seemed under explained and a bit cliche, what would have been a more interesting approach is if The New Republic had a moral failing that ultimately landed them in the position as galactic oppressors. I think having Luke act in a similar role to Vader in the original trilogy would certainly cement his legacy as a Grey Jedi, as well as avoid the awkwardness of having to try to establish both a hero and a villain from scratch within the story. It would also be interesting thematically as a carry through theme from both the original trilogy and the prequels that absolute power corrupts absolutely. I would also personally love to hear a reprise on some of the Rebel Alliance victory themes as darker more twisted versions to show the way that the faction has chosen to role of oppressor rather than fighting for the repressed. There could even be an opportunity for a dark side force user to act as the main hero, showing that there is not truly a good or evil way to engage with the force. What do you all think?"
374,1631779886.0,StarWarsTheories,"They weren't on target: Why red leader missed and the force was needed. - So, in trying to reconcile in my head a distinction between the ""shape"" of the death star in the X wing/Y wing targeting computers and as clearly seen in the plans and in the movie, I have some interesting head cannon. Basically if you look at https://imgur.com/a/JWLuhWy, the ""target"" is actually NOT where the exhaust port is. The target appears to be at the end of the trench FACING the fighters, but we all know the exhaust port is in fact BELOW the fighter at the end of the trench, given their orientation. What if THIS is why red leader missed? Basically, my theory is that somehow the targeting computer was locked on to the wrong part of the death star, and this was why a) Red Leader missed, and b) why the force was needed to make the shot. 

There is actually some cannon support for this. The port was small, and there is concern that ""the computer can hit it"" during the briefing. As we all know from watching the movie, the concern was entirely valid. 

The main ""reason"" for my post is the idea that we could use a cannon accurate targeting computer for mods/games with star-fighters from the OT era (ie - mods for X wing alliance) have it functionally work as shown in the movies. For example, in a starfighter game you could use the targeting computer to filter out obstacles in the way of your target (walls, asteroids, other ships) while still maintaining the ""feel"" and ""look"" of the  movies."

On Kamino, the Bad Batch have just landed.  They act natural so they don't draw too much attention to themselves, that is until they bump into a young girl named Omega.  She tries to talk to them for a bit, seeming to be very excited to meet them until Hunter very politely tells her they have something to take care of and they can talk later.  The 5 clones head towards the cloning tanks where every clone is grown, Tech thinks the best place to find anything on the chips would be in there.  Tech hacks into the systems of Tapoca city to cause a massive distraction and divert everyone away from the cloning tanks.  Searching the database, Tech discovers first that there are actually 5 enhanced clones which strikes him as odd until Hunter says they aren't alone.  The Bad Batch discover that Omega had followed them, she shows them where the chips are and explains she's actually the 5th enhanced clone.  Omega explains she is Nala Se's, the head scientist, medical assistant and that she knew about the chips but she didn't know about Order 66 or that it would make the clones act violent.  She tells them earlier today, the Jedi who was currently on Kamino left in a hurry and was helped out by some teenaged cadets.  The Jedi left Kamino but Omega was horrified when she saw the cadets gunned down by clone troopers, calling them traitors who violated Order 66.  All the members of Clone force 99 were shocked by this, cadets that age wouldn't be armed outside of training and any armor they had would have never taken a real blaster bolt.  Tech copies everything on the inhibitor chips onto a data rod and says that any minute now the Kaminoans and clones would get their distraction under control and discover them here.  Hunter realizes that they can't leave Omega behind, if the chips caused clones to kill unarmed cadets then she was on the chopping block too.  Before Hunter can even ask if Omega wants to come with the Bad Batch, she says yes but it was less out of fear and more out excitement.  The Bad Batch is just barely able to get to their ship before the clones are able to route troopers towards the intruders.  They are shot at by fighter as they barely make it into hyperspace.

While in hyperspace, Echo establishes a connection with Rex hoping that he wasn't affected by Order 66.  When both Ahsoka and Rex appear on the hologram, they knew that they could send everything they just retrieved from Kamino to them.  The Bad Batch explains everything that happened between Kaller and now including Omega.  Rex and Ahsoka seem a bit surprised by their story especially Omega.  Rex tells the Bad Batch their location so they can transfer the intel to Jedi on Alderaan and that the minute they board the star destroyer he wants them to go to the medical bay and get their chips removed.  He'd rather not risk the safety of Ahsoka or anyone else on board and the enhanced clones agreed.  Ahsoka thanks the Bad batch for what they did and thinks if they get it to Senator Organa then he would be able to take it to the senate.

The Star destroyer with Ahsoka, Rex and the Bad batch in tow make it to Alderaan and they are able to give everything that they have on the inhibitor chips to the Jedi council.  Senator Organa and Mon Mothma are incredibly interested in this intel, they plan to take a copy of it and the recording of Palpatine attacking Anakin with a lightsaber as well as shooting lightning from his fingers to the Galactic Senate.  Padme wants to join them but the medical droid tells her that she shouldn't be walking for a few days let alone going to political discussions and doesn't sign off on her leaving Alderaan.  This potentially saves her life.  When the Galactic senate holds a meeting on the supposed betrayal of the Jedi, Senator Organa along with the Delegation of 2000 reveal the footage of Chancellor Palpatine's true identity as well as the accusation of treason against the Jedi is false.  The Senator explains that the clones were forced to kill their Generals with chips that were implanted in them at birth by the Kaminoans with dozens of orders programmed into said chips and the only way it could be activated was by the Supreme Chancellor himself.  This shocks the senate but Chancellor Palpatine just laughs and laughs, it wasn't jovial but dripping with evil and malice.  He thanks the Senate for their service and says they are no longer required, before anyone has anytime to process this he unleashes a massive storm of force lightning into the congregation.  Many senators are injured but many more are killed, Senators Organa and Mon Mothma are the lucky to just get injured.  In the ensuing panic, Palpatine walks to his personal ship and leaves for the CIS.

Darth Sidious unleashed such a major attack to cripple the Galactic Republic and decides to throw his lot in with the CIS.  He was planning on killing the council who truly controlled the Seperatists but he decided it might just be easier to overrun the Galactic republic with an overwhelming tide of battle droids.  After overlooking the damage of the Galactic Senate, among the injured is Senator Lux Bontari and a large number of the Delegation but among the dead are Senator Orn Free Taa, Representive  Jar Jar Binks and every single member of the Naboo representation present beside Padme as well as many other Senators.  It appears that Palpatine targeted the Naboo delegates because while his true target Senator Amidala wasn't present, he could at least make her hurt and send a message.  Padme is distraught at the loss of many of her friends as well as many Jedi, Jar Jar may have been a bit clumsy but he had the mind of a child and would never hurt a soul.

On Alderaan, the Jedi assess their damages.  Only Master Plo, Master Yoda and Master Windu came back.  Other Jedi that were able to return were Caleb Dume, Master Jaro Tapal and his padawan as well as a select few others.  The galaxy is in so much chaos, no one can tell how many are dead or just gone underground.  The council decides to stay on Alderaan and to broadcast a signal in Jedi code so that anyone left can return.  After a long discussion and an amazing speech from Obi wan, the council decides to not expel Anakin from the order.  Their reasons are that it was clear that Palpatine was manipulating him but his near fall into darkness was a wake up call.  The Order needed to change otherwise this could happen again.  The council decided to give Anakin the rank of master because despite the unyielding torrent of powerful emotions he was going through, he fought tooth and nail to not fall.

While the senate is crippled, Senator Organa is named Chancellor and he orders that the clone troopers have their chips removed immediately so no one can take their minds ever again.  The Jedi are allowed to stay on Alderaan but the Republic very quickly realizes as the droid army sweeps across the galaxy that the clones and Jedi aren't enough.  Citing the success of training Saw Gerrara and the help of Cham Syndulla, the Senate decides to conscript soldiers to supplement the clones.  Although the Clone war is far from over, the Republic isn't out of the fight just yet.

Ahsoka decides to stay with the order because while she's not a Jedi, she can't abandon the people she cares about most, eventually she returns to the Order and is given the rank of Knight.  Anakin and Padme raise Luke and Leia and they eventually join the order, becoming as strong as their dad.  Obi wan decides to take Caleb as a padawan, understanding the pain of his master's loss.  The Clones fight on and the inhibitor chips aren't placed in any future clones as they are completely banned, the Kaminoans are kept under very close observation and lost a ton of trust.  Eventually, Hera joins her dad and meets young Caleb, both hit it off almost immediately and go on many missions together.  On one mission, they find a young force sensitive boy named Ezra Bridger and bring him to the Temple.  The war rips the Galaxy apart for years and years, especially since General Grievous escaped Master Windu's blade, but no one gives up hope.  One day, Anakin and Palpatine will fight again and when that happens Skywalker won't be alone.  There is another after all.

The Jedi ships fall out of hyperspace, not too far from Coruscant but only to let the fighter ships to board them.  After this, all the ships return to hyperspace and set course for the Alderaan system.  The war isn't there and so there aren't any clone troopers on the planet as well as the fact that Senator Organa is a long time friend of the Jedi and would be able to help them out.  Anakin had also informed the council he had R2 with him to record his interaction with Sidious and had sent R2 off to be with Padme who was staying with Senator Organa and Mon Mothma.  He didn't tell them why she was there outside of the fact she wanted a bit of company as her pregnancy nears to an end, although this did raise a few eyebrows and they didn't seem too convinced.  Anakin was all by himself in the hangar of the Jedi ship.  He was enraged at Sidious' betrayal but he was also upset and terrified.  Anakin knew that Ahsoka was out there surrounded by the 501st, his soldiers whom he fought with for years.  Anakin was also terrified at the prospect that Sidious would try to find and kill Padme as well as his fears that Sidious was some how inside his head and was behind his visions.  He had no idea whether these visions were his own or Sidious trying to manipulate him.  This was slowly ripping his frail psyche apart and it didn't go unnoticed.

Far away in the Mandalore system, the last member of the 501st division that was sent there has had their chip removed.  After Ahsoka had received the message, Rex told her everything he knew about what Fives had told him months ago.  Hearing this, she ordered every single Clone chip removed and went to the detention cells.  She opened Maul's cell and demanded he tell her everything.  Maul told her the truth about what he knew, nothing.  He had no idea about Order 66 and honestly thought it was hilarious.  But he was unhelpful and cryptic about the information on Sidious.  He may no longer be Sidious' apprentice but he also liked watching Ahsoka and the other Jedi squirm.  After this, Ahsoka went back to the bridge and tried to search through the Force for Anakin but she only found darkness surrounding him.  She told the clones to set course for Alderaan, until she and Rex get a message . . . from Echo.

On Kaller, the Bad batch had just shown up to help General Bilaba and her Padawan Caleb when they received the message from the Temple.  Thankfully Commander Grey and small group of clones had overheard the message and they wanted to help get their General and Commander to safety.  Tech immediately surmissed that the inhibitor chips that Kaminoans put in all their troops had something to do with and told the other clones to abandon their comms and turn their internal comms off just in case so it didn't spread while the Bad Batch did the same.  The Bad Batch ran towards the nearest ships with Caleb while Depa and her clones stayed at the back to cover them.  Almost immediately they heard shouting from the currently activated clones.  Depa decides to slow them down as much as she can and orders Caleb to go with the clones.  He does as his master says and while he's running with the others they hear blaster fire until it all stops and Caleb feels his master's light go out forever.  Taking a quick breather just outside of the landing pad, Hunter tells Caleb to go with the other clones and tell the Jedi that Clone force 99 is going to go to Kamino to get as much information as they can on these chips.  The small squads of clones part ways and blast off into two different directions.

Back on the Jedi ships, Anakin is slowly spiraling and losing the battle with his inner dark side.  He feels a gentle hand on his shoulder and another smaller one on his arm.  He looks up to see Obi wan and Yoda.  They try to do their best to soothe his mind and while it works for a time, he is somewhere in between the light and dark.  The Jedi ships land and are greeted by Bail Organa and Mon Mothma, Padme is nowhere to be seen.  Asking about this, Senator Organa says she has gone into labor.  Immediately Anakin rushes towards the medical center that Senator Organa told them about while Obi wan runs after him.  Getting to the medical center, Anakin sees the most wonderful sight he has ever seen.  Padme smiled at him sleepily and introduced him to his newborn twins, Luke and Leia.  Anakin cries with happiness as he holds his twins in his arms, not noticing that Obi wan was right behind him or that the other Jedi masters including Master Yoda and Mace Windu who had just returned from Utapau had joined him.  It didn't take long for them to figure out exactly what was going on and Master Windu was furious.  He yelled at Anakin for breaking the code but was quickly silenced by Obi wan and surprisingly the other council members.  Master Yoda told him to leave Anakin alone and let him have some peace even for a moment, he knew exactly how upset Anakin was after meeting up with him on the ships.  Masters Plo Koon and Kit Fisto scolded Mace because they had bigger things to worry about and they will debate on this new knowledge later.  Mace was still very upset, the other Jedi weren't interested in upsetting Anakin after sensing his turbulent emotions earlier and they also were more focused on the problem with the clones as well as what to do next with all the young Jedi as well as the new Sith lord.  Until they got a transmission from Ahsoka and the Bad Batch.  They had information on the chips that the Jedi should hear about."

378,1631280315.0,StarWarsTheories,"What Happens to Grogu (And maybe Omega) at the End of The Mandalorian - Theory - So to preface this theory, I just want to explain a little bit from where I'm coming from. It's not deep or anything, nor does it necessarily give a lot credence to my theory or theories, but I do feel like it gives my thoughts some context.

So there have been a lot rumors, theories, conversations about where Grogu is during the time of the sequel trilogy. There are a few fans that think Grogu was at Luke's school with Ben Solo.

I however think that is a big mistake---that it would open up too big of plot holes for the sequel trilogy, especially if Rey turns out to have some of Grogu's DNA via her father...If Ben Solo knew about Grogu, there would surely be an ongoing quest for him and The Knights of Ren via Snoke via Palpatine, and Ben should of then been able to put this whole thing (force cloning, sith loyalists) together faster...

The other thing I have been thinking about is Omega. There have been rumors that she could turn up in The Book of Boba Fett. Something that I also think would make a lot of sense, because again The Mandalorian is in part about filling in some of the back story to the sequel trilogy, ala Palpatine/Sith Loyalists cloning schemes. There was a rumor that actress Sophie Thatcher (actually I think Deadline originally reported this) had a role in TBOBF. When I look at the actress, I can easily see her getting away with a live action version of Omega, except for the fact that she is not a New Zealand actress and is only 20 yrs old.  But this still prompted me to wonder if the character maybe somehow didn't age...

When I thought about Grogu and where he might be during the sequel trilogy, I had thought maybe he time traveled via The World Between Worlds, especially since Ahsoka has been brought into The Mandoverse and we're hopefully going to finally understand what her deal with The Daughter, TWBW, and her over all future mandate is going to be.

But when I was thinking about Thatcher and Omega, I thought about freezing in Carbonite, because that is the method that really goes with The Book of Boba Fett in relation to his past dealings when we look at Return of the Jedi and the current War of the Bounty Hunters comic series.

But then I thought that is almost too predictable! So what if both things are true. One character was put in Carbonite and another brought forward in time (at some point) by Ahsoka?

What if Ahsoka saves Omega and brings into the Mandoverse era AND at the end of The Mandalorian Din Djarin agrees (with Luke?) to put Grogu in Carbonite!! And maybe this is also two-fold. That this is about both hiding Grogu from the Sith Loyalists, but also about protecting Grogu from himself---there are some hints that Grogu might be too powerful, go dark, or just simply be out of control...This also would be a kind of extended proverbial nail in Luke's 'Last Jedi' speech to Rey about his hubris...

Maybe Omega with Ahsoka is then charged with protecting Grogu, while Din takes a more active role on Mandalore to help Bo-Katan?! But the Carbonite Grogu just seems so fitting because of both the way The Mandalorian started AND because of Han Solo (a big plot and cliffhanger of the OT was Han in Carbonite) and the way Kylo Ren/Ben Solo kind of misses out or dances around ever really knowing Grogu...Heck maybe even Han (at one point) transports Grogu while toddler Ben is with him! That would be some great great irony!

Anyways it was just something that crossed my mind."
379,1631073449.0,StarWarsTheories,"What if Anakin told Obi wan about his marriage to Padme? Pt 1 - This would take place some time during Revenge of the Sith for context.  I'm aware that Obi wan knows that Anakin and Padme are in love if that comment in Season 7 of Clone wars meant anything but whether he knows they are actually married is debatable.

After yet another sleepless night of visions of his beloved wife dying and his unborn child suffering a similar fate, Anakin just stares out over the Coruscant skyline.  Padme joins him and after hearing about his dreams, she urges that Anakin talk to Obi wan.  Anakin is hesitant because he doesn't want to tell Obi wan of his marriage because he might tell the council.  Padme says that Obi wan would keep it a secret and would just try his best to help.  Anakin pauses then agrees after reflecting on his past with the man who is basically his father.  In the morning, Anakin goes to Obi wan and while fumbling over his words to explain his relationship to Padme, Obi wan is rather amused by his brother's struggle to tell him something he already knows.  When Anakin gets to his dreams and about his prior conversations to Palpatine about these dreams as well as a few of the Chancellor's odd comments, Obi wan loses his smile and is rather perturbed by this news.  He tells Anakin that he will do a bit of research at the temple and to tell him anything else that Palpatine says.  Before leaving, Obi wan reassures Anakin that he will not tell anyone on the council about this but also warns Anakin that when his child is born that his relationship with Padme might be a bit obvious since he is the only man that Padme has spent a lot of time with.  Because of this, Obi wan requests to stay on Coruscant saying that he wants to re-train his skills and re-center himself in the Force.  This leaves Mace Windu to go to Utapau to fight Grievous.

When Anakin goes to the ballet with Palpatine, Obi wan follows him into the building.  Giving the Chancellor a white lie that Anakin had invited him to try and mend their frayed relationship, the yet to be unmasked Sith lord fakes delight at the older Jedi's presence.  During the ballet, Palpatine tells Anakin about Darth Plaguies the wise, thinking that his tone is soft enough for Obi wan to not hear him.  However, Obi wan can make out bits but Anakin fills him in on the rest.  When Obi wan says that despite the limited records of Sith lore in the vaults of the Temple there is no mention of this Sith lord in the records, Anakin thinks to himself how and why does Palpatine have more knowledge on the Sith that even the meticulous records of the Temple doesn't.  Obi wan wants to review some of the oddities that poked their heads out during the war, especially the knowledge that Dooku created the clone army and the inhibitor chips Fives was rambling about which also grabs Anakin's attention as he was present during his ARC trooper's final moments.  Obi wan tells Anakin that no matter what the Chancellor says next under no circumstances should he trust anything he says, reassuring Anakin that he will do everything to make sure Padme is okay.  While Obi wan is doing this, Anakin tells Padme to go and spend time with her senator friends, Bail Organa and Mon Mothma, so that she has a bit of added protection as well as extra health care.

After going over what they have on the inhibitor chips and having a few of the clones who worked in the Temple tested for the chips, Obi wan and Anankin conclude that Dooku in all likelihood had a hand in the creation of the chips as well as their purpose.  Clone trooper Tup's chip malfunctioning caused him to kill a Jedi but healthy chips might need a signal or something to truly activate and many Jedi are currently out in the field are surrounded by ticking time bombs.  After concluding that Dooku was the apprentice and Palpatine is most definitely the master, Anakin goes off to confront him while Obi wan orders the Temple to be evacuated and to have every Jedi in the field warned to get as far away from their clones as possible.  Just like in Revenge of the Sith, Anakin goes to Palpatine's office and confronts him with the older human revealing his true identity.  However, unlike in Revenge of the Sith, Anakin is enraged by this and is trying to hold back his lightsaber from striking the person responsible for all the suffering and death he saw in the field.  But he can't because Palpatine is still the legal leader of the Republic, sensing this weakness Palpatine strikes at Anakin.  After a short battle, Anakin uses all his might to shove Palpatine into the wall, knocking him out.  During this moment, R2 is hiding just out of sight, ordered by Anakin to record everything that happened so whatever happens next there will be evidence of Palpatine's lies and his identity as a Sith.

Anakin rushes to the Temple, along the way telling R2 to go to Padme and tell her what happened and to get off Coruscant ASAP.  Just as Anakin gets to the Temple, he hears the sounds of LAATI descending with the ships and clones inside opening fire on the Temple as Anakin is about to land.  Just before the gunships make another round, a group of large ships burst from the hangar and several fighters dart out to quickly disable the LAATI before they can attack.  Anakin turns his ship around and follows the ships full of Jedi out into the sky.  Just barely making it out of the atmosphere and entering hyperspace as soon as they could, getting away from the clone ships who just barely had time to open fire."
380,1630895559.0,StarWarsTheories,"I have an idea about the pregnancy of Anakin's mother and mystery of his father and - Warning*silly pseudoscience ahead*Warning

Edit: per request, I am adding:

Per request: SPOILER ALERT!!!!

TL;DR: George Lucas changed many parts of his movies with digital alterations...but never removed the incestuous kiss between twins (aka ""twincest). I contend that the incestuous kiss resulted in massive disturbances (or quantum fluctuations) in the Midichlorion field, which resulted in the formation of a Boltzmann brain and this brain lead to the fatherless existence of Anakin and explains his connection to the force. Please read my entire post, as I'm not looking to argue. This is just fun to occupy my mind through the intense mundanity of life. Thanks! Jesus saves...on double coupons.

Please read the entire theory...this covers multiple levels and a little layman's poor comprehension of quantum quantum field theory. It's just a field of values between particles of the field... right? More particle density would lead to differences in field numbers and distance between particles could lead to areas of the field with values that are functionally neutral... however random fluctuations in even the quietest field can birth a particle.

This idea involves a bastardized version of modern quantum field theory by someone with no real mathematical knowledge of the theory. This theory is 100% in jest, but not completely insane. 

This is stemming from the vast amount of pop science research I've done (being cheeky from a layman's perspective and understanding of physics). My area of scientific expertise is mostly unrelated to physics on a typical practical basis (yes, physics still affects everything)

In the simplest terms, I'm thinking of the midichlorons as particles similar to fundamental particles within the field of particle physics (e.g leptons and Bosons...and Midichlorons would be Bosons as force carrying particles based on physics in the real world like photons, w, z, gluons, Higgs Bosons and that's all I can think of at the moment). The Midichlorons are not sentient. That is merely a superstition from the Jedi, who were a religious order and were not scientifically trained or knowledgeable. I say the idea of sentience is merely dogma passed through the ages as much dogma exists within the Jedi order that really did not stand the test of time (much like samurai). 

Midichlorions, though not sentient, give shape to the field. The field is going to be strongest where there is an abundance of particles and let's just say their particle spin must be lined up in a particular way (like the charge in magnetism) and humans with an abundance of these particles in their body have greater control of this quantum field known as ""The Force"" because somehow their nervous system can interact with the field through the Midichlorons present in the body. In this way, high Midichlorion count (Just gonna say...my explanation is way better than Lucas's...am I write (sic))?) I would guess the power of the force works in a similar manner to gravity's inverse square equation. My thinking is that for some evolutionary reason, there is a connection between particular parts of the brain and Midichlorons activity. My hypothesis is that Midichlorons are particles involved with consciousness and very much with the sense of self often associated with the default mode network. This is the reason for Buddhist similarities to the Jedi. Meditation is similar to how the Jedi fight. They hold off that sense of self and flow with the force instead. When consumed by the sense self, midichlorions are shit off or their effects are tempered. When consumed with unchecked emotions, the midichlorions become unstable and results in eventual madness. One may be able to yield greater power, but that power is more difficult to control and less predictable.

However, here's the big thing...even in parts of the field less likely to yield midichlorion particles through random field fluctuations, there may still be such fluctuations occuring to enough of an extent to create actual particles out of the field...or seemingly from nowhere (or we could get into tunnelling too). Some may be familiar with the idea of a Boltzmann Brain if you religiously watch ""Space Time"" on YouTube. Well, bear with me, because I'm headed somewhere that few of you may have expected. Be prepared for pseudoscience ahead! 

I go on. Within physics there's this sort of far out idea more than a hypothesis or theory. The idea is basically that given infinite time and space, IF POSSIBLE, it is inevitable that a sentient brain will form spontaneously through completely random fluctuations within quantum fields. Some hypothesize that this is how a universe comes to exist to begin with: random fluctuations and infinite opportunities.

Now you have the background of my thinking...and now you must prepare for an idea that will blow your mind or make you laugh. It's meant to be a little of both. Tongue in cheek...but I'm trying for real.

I contend that due to an extremely powerful, rare, and universe twisting disturbance in the force... A Boltzmann Brain was formed from quantum fluctuations and that brain either became the incarnate body of Anakin, or the father.

Now...you think that's the end. I know. I'm not even going to out in a TL;DR, because I want everyone to get to this part, and hear my explanation for where this idea came from this evening.

I recently got myself a few good copies of the original trilogy without the stupid digital additions that don't fit. I would estimate that I've not seen anything but a Lucas bastardized version of these films in at least 25 years. 

While watching, I began to realize how different they had made the movie when going back to watch the originals. They put in stupid CGI that didn't fit, pointless extra scenes, and too much more to name. 

HOWEVER, with an opportunity to make changes and fix tiny parts that didn't make sense, there is one thing that was never changed: the incestuous and fairly passionate kiss. Clearly Lucas had changed his mind and decided to make them siblings AFTER A New Hope. Either that or there must be a reason for the kiss... A kiss that happens to be between two of the greatest force carriers if all time...

Here comes my attempt to blow minds. Anyone slightly familiar with pop science is aware of LIGO and our detections of gravitational waves. I predict that there are also midichlorion waves. When there is a ""disturbance in the force"" it is always a force sensitive being causing this disturbance...or maybe they should be called ""Quantum fluctuations"" to relate then to our own science. 

Now, this is where I'm going to bring this shit together. Consider the kiss as being akin to a black hole collision that sends gravitational waves so powerful they could rip us apart if close enough. Luke and Leia are so powerful and have such an amazingly strong influence on the force that their kiss resulted in a short lived combination of their Midichlorion power and in quantum fluctuations so strong that a Boltzmann brain formed. That brain either found its way into the womb of Anakin's mother or is the father of Anakin. Thus, Anakin was spawned by an incestuous kiss that caused massive ripples in the Midichlorion field leading to such an abundance of random fluctuations that it bore a timeless Boltzmann brain... meaning it's always existed in a strange way. In this way, Luke and Leia must exist for Anakin to exist and vice versa. Also realize that in order for the Boltzmann brain to exist...Luke and Leia MUST kiss...so they MUST be born and the must be seperated, meaning Anakin never had a choice. Thus the brain must always assure that Anakin joins the Darkside or it won't exist because the children will not be seperated and the kiss will never happen.. Anakin never exists.

This is why Lucas did not remove incest in his changes. It was actually of vital importance to the story."
381,1630510189.0,StarWarsTheories,"Orla Janreni: And Evolution from the High Republic to The Temple Guardians - &#x200B;

I apologize in advance if someone else already worked to make this possible connection.

The High Republic in part serves as a way to inform The Skywalker Saga, most notably in showing how the Jedi philosophy evolved from a more liberal and open-minded order to the much more rigid and fearful order depicted during the prequel trilogy.

But one of the more intriguing aspects of the prequel era of The Skywalker Saga is the Temple Guardians. There isn't much known about this division of the order. Only that masters can somehow join and become anonymous members who ""guard"" the temple. It's unclear if The High Council gets to choose who joins this faction and/or how much control they have over these guardians in general and/or if they ever have other none-temple relate missions or mandates.

But it's construct mostly centers around the individual who eventually turns on the Order and become ""The Grand Inquisitor"" working for Vader/The Empire in hunting down surviving Jedi after Order 66. Despite the character's death, the origins, life, and struggle of this character still remain a mystery...

But when one looks at the works within the High Republic so far, there is a lot of juxtapositions to the Skywalker Saga. Many characters (Zeen, Orla, Vernestra, Ty) or plots seem to dance around SS characters Anakin, Ahsoka, and Reylo in particular. (Although there are some Obi-Wan like dynamics between Stellen, Elzar, and Avar...)

With that said, when one looks at the aesthetics for the Jedi-related stuff in The High Republic (And the Insignia) it is VERY similar to the aesthetics worn by the Temple Guardians.  


(*I made a collage for right here, but I can not add it, sorry!*)

But when we look at Orla Jareni in particular (so far), we see an Umbarian, who has VERY white skin, a double-sided lightsaber ala hinge, and a character who has taken on the role known in this era as ""Wayseeker"".

So all of this points to the idea of Temple Guardians, whom wear white with gold masks to hide their identities, The Grand Inquisitor (whom also has rather white skin being Pau'an), and double-bladed (yellow) lightsabers are the ""official"" weapon of the Temple Guardians.

There are also winks to Rey as well, given the hinge on the lightsaber points to Rey's dark side force visions weapon (and dark-haired bun) and that Rey also ends with a yellow blade, like many temple guardians (granted that yellow is also associated with other characters, including a recent Marvel comic with Luke Skywalker or the High Republic's Master Loden Greatstorm...) But the Wayseeker part points to both the sequel trilogy as there are ""Wayfinders"" (and the Paths are similar concept) and Ahsoka Tano, who isn't a ""wayseeker"" per say since that seems to require returning to and/or still working with The Order at some point, but Ahsoka does seem to stay on lighter side of things, despite her disagreement with the Order/and or it's demise.

But getting back to the point, all of this does make me wonder \*If Orla Jareni is somehow responsible for the creation of the Temple Guardians and if her story will eventually be linked (or even just uniquely juxtaposed) to The Grand Inquisitor's own missing backstory??? Let alone how The High Republic might extend itself to things post TROS....

The thing that is curious is that The Tempe Guardians almost seem like something that would of been created out of fear after some particular event and seems in line with the shift between the Jedi of the previous era and that of the Skywalker Saga."

starkiller is my favorite star wars character and i always think of ways on how he could end up being canon. sharing my latest thought here. 

what if now that wayland is a canon planet they’re making a clone of galen marek and vader sees a piece of anakin in him as a child and has a liking to him so he trains the real galen and stops the cloning of him 

since a new hope is 17 years away from ROTS (i believe) they could make galen a bit older like 15 for a start of his character entry and he can start hunting jedi at 17. although we don’t know the time gap from order 66 to the reveal of wayland nor time of capturing if this were real that wouldn’t really matter. he’s a young boy with high potential, brainwashed easily. 

a show of him would be the first season of him hunting (basically all the levels from the force unleashed 1) and the ending he would turn against vader for the same reasons. although i don’t think he’d have a huge part in the beginning of the rebel alliance he could be a small canon catalyst of them (if there’s not already idk if there is besides the squad from star wars rebels). 

in season 2 he could be 20/21 and just die by vader in an epic battle to end his story. the second season would basically be the second game just with major changes (would be really cool to see him meet yoda on dagobah). or instead of yoda on dagobah it could be obi on tattooine. or even ahsoka on the planet din djarin (mandalorian) met her on. with that being said this show would take place of a max year span of 7 years. from a year after order 66 - 6 years later, so 7 years in total (introduced at 15, dies at 21 years old latest). far stretch from luke’s story 17 years after order 66. if anything he could even start hunting at 17 and just die at 19 to make it faster and easier to write for the creators. 

what do you think of this?"
386,1629117972.0,StarWarsTheories,"Palpatine paid the Tusken Raiders to Capture and Torment Shmi Skywalker - After much thought this isn’t that far fetched, granted this is my first time posting here so I’m sure you all will tear this apart. I’m going to attempt it anyway. 

Tusken Raiders are a nomadic people of Tatooine and possibly other desert planets. We’ve seen them throughout the whole saga as well as in the TV shows and comic books. While they are well known for their antics and causing havoc, it is not in there nature to capture someone and keep them hostage while also tormenting them. In some rare instances they capture younger individuals to make them a part of their tribe. This definitely points to Palpatine, who knew that this course of events would send Anakin on his path to the dark side. As a nomadic people they are constantly on the move hence why it took Anakin a while to find the tribe that captured Shmi. This would make it increasingly difficult to hold someone hostage as it would require more food and water for an additional mouth that didn’t participate in their day to day life. 

For those of you who aren’t familiar there are two Tusken Jedi Knights Sharad and A’sharad Hett. A’sharad Hett eventually becomes Darth Krayt after the death of Palpatine. Sharad Hett, his father, was alive during the time of the clone wars and the great purge. Sharad confronts Anakin about his attack on the Tuskens. Anakin does not reveal what he has done to anyone except for Padme and Palpatine. There is only one way Sharad could have discovered this."

Video to follow along notes if preferred: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YzLkc-Z7R4

Before I discuss my diagnosis of Yoda’s reverse Alagille syndrome I will have to briefly explain what Alagille syndrome is. Alagille syndrome is an autosomal dominant disorder. It is caused by a mutation that causes a development of fewer ducts to drain bile hence building up bile. It is associated with cirrhosis and hepatocellular carcinoma. You may also see ophthalmologic and vertebral defects. On vertebral imaging you may see a butterfly vertebra. Treatment to improve bile flow is w/t ursodiol and cholestyramine for pruritus much like many other hepatic and biliary pathologic diseases. Treatment may involve a complete liver transplant or creating artificial ducts.

So now I will be discussing reverse Alagille syndrome (aka hyper biliary duplication)**.** The hypothesis is that Yoda has excessive amounts of anomalous ducts located through out his body which leads to fully body jaundice. His body may have adapted to having a high absorption and low excretion rate of bile. This can cause jaundice due to the excessive bilirubin spilling or just the presence of the extra direct bilirubin. The severity of the disease may be correlates with the enlarged size or number of ducts/gallbladders. You may see extrahepatic liver tissue. The excess stimulation may cause hyperplasia of the hepatic tissue or cells. Yoda has been shown to display extraordinary physical feats at will, this may be due to voluntary release of bile at moments to enhance his physical capabilities at a moments notice. Overuse of this ability may cause excessive wear and tear on his body which would explain the slow movements and poor posture. The excessive bile may allow rapid absorption of vitamins. Which may initially display hypervitaminosis but will later deplete storage supplies. He may present with symptoms of vit d def pagets disease and osteopetrosis. Other vitamins may be deficient as well. Due to signaling from the body unconjugated bilirubin may build up which may cross the blood brain barrier and explain Yoda's abnormal speech patterns. One thing to note is that this disease decreases the likelihood of bile stones due to bypassing ducts to drain the bile and it also has decreased likelihood complication of biliary stasis complications such as ascending cholangitis due to the bypass ducts excessive flow reserves and stimulation. Treatment may include cutting off or clipping the initial branches near the central ducts. This will cause the accessory ducts to die off and be excreted or absorbed by the body. They may also act as a nidus for infection. In which case we shall provide with i.v antibiotics. Another treatment that isn’t as effective would be to do partial or full duodenal resection to decrease stimulation of bile release. We may give cholestyramine to excrete the bile as a temporary measure. For severe and refractory cases, a liver transplant may be required."

391,1628080133.0,StarWarsTheories,"How I believe a Clone Rebellion will play out. - I'm gonna come out and say that I do not believe any Clone Rebellion will happen in Season 1. There are two episodes left and we have only seen six clones (Not including the Bad Batch and Rex) defy orders. If a clone rebellion is to happen it will need more time to plan and more  clones to question the Empire.

&#x200B;

How will this rebellion play out though? Well I believe it will stem from a number of things;

\- The revelation that clones will be replaced by conscripts

\- The Empire ordering clones to carry out more and more sinister missions like subjugating planets and killing civilians.

\- The possible publishing of Fives' story by Rex and clones becoming aware of the inhibitor chips and how the Jedi shouldn't have died.

&#x200B;

I believe these aspects will come together and result in a Galaxywide Clone Rebellion and a short war inside the Empire where Clones battle with Stormtroopers. I feel Rex and a few other clones who questioned orders like Gregor and Howzer will reach out to clones across the Galaxy via comlink or holograms telling clones everywhere the truth, that the Empire are training conscripted soldiers, inhibitor chips controlled the clones' minds prompting them to kill their Jedi comrades, and now the Republic the clones fought for has been destroyed. This message would spread across the galaxy just like Order 66 had and would prompt the clones to rise up against their Imperial Officers. 

Of course the rebellion will be a failure, and I feel this is how we see the deaths of many beloved clones from the Clone Wars, however, it would bring a sense of justice as the last time we've seen many of these clones was when order 66 came. To see the clones fight back in revenge for their Jedi would be an excellent end to the arcs for most clones. Finally, after the rebellion, Palpatine would put a stop to all clone production, shutting down Kamino entirely and fully replacing the army with Stormtroopers."
392,1627875862.0,StarWarsTheories,"Batch Batch: A three-sided war - So a lot of people have been talking about the idea that the Kaminoan Rebellion from Legends is going to be recanonised in the Bad Batch, and I think that is still likely to happen >!despite the implied death of Lama Su. !<However, they seem to be taking the idea further with a faction of clones becoming more independent. One of the weaknesses of the Inhibitor Chips as a storytelling device is it takes away the agency and the impact of the clones having a Law vs Good moment, but Filoni has taken this and used it ti apply a Moral Injury, What have I done moment. As demonstrated by Howzer and his other clones and to a lesser extent >!Gregor!< There are more and more clones becoming aware.

We also see the Kaminoan plans that need Jango Fetts DNA, suggesting they are trying to clone their Anti-Troopers and seem to be accelerating their plans due to the >!Empire evacuating the planet!< in the latest episode.

However the rebellious clones seem to be lead, or at least coordinated by Rex, who with his experiences with Fives, is not well disposed to the Kaminoans and it is doubtful that these clones, learning the Kaminoans effectively made them commit Order 66, would then side with them.

Therefore what seems likely is that more and more clones, those who had genetic flaws or were particularly close to Jedi start to desert, which feeds into Tarkin and the Emperors idea that Clones are too corruptable and outdated, leading to the accerlated phasing out of clones. This sets off the rebellion of the Kaminoans and simulatiously a mutiny by the disillusioned clones.

Overall this means three factions of Clones all fighting each other for different sides.

The rebellion or proto rebellion has been absent from this piece because I belive it will take a long time for the clones to overcome their distate of the CIS. Which was a major part of the early rebellion due to their existing military facilities. But the clones are very apprehensive to working with the CIS, Echo is displeased with rescuing the Senator and Rex shows in Rebels, many years later he is still opposed to working with Battle Droids.

393,1627805264.0,StarWarsTheories,Theory Ezra Bridger was the most powerful star wars character for a moment!!! - In the episode world between worlds we seen Ezra pull Ahsoka out of the fight with Vader which saved her cuz Vader was about to end her.If Ezra changed Ahsoka's fate that means he could have changed the fate of lots of people who have died or maybe changed history in star wars.Ezra could have stopped Anakin from slicing off Mace Windu's arm and maybe prevented Anakin from turning to the dark side.Now you might be wondering how can Ezra can do all this well in the episode world between worlds we seen Ezra going into a portal which take Ezra somewhere when he can see events that happened in star wars.Ahsoka vs Vader was a event that Ezra changed.Let me know do you agree with my theory or do you disagree?

396,1627540561.0,StarWarsTheories,"Rex at the Battle of Genosis - Here’s my Rex Theory.

We know Rex was given his rank because of training from canon back story. We also know he was at both battles of Geonosis. We know he is a first generation clone.

Rex was the clone that fell out with Padme, that helps her and she sends off to get transportation, more clones, etc. After she tells him to do that, he does and above and beyond that, protecting her from stray droids (maybe from ships shot down?) that we’re trying to finish her off. After getting a ship and Padme; they rush to Anakin, Yoda, and Obi Wan in the hanger moments after Douku escapes (possibly firing on him as he’s leaving). Upon landing in the hanger, Rex is already leading the charge based on his orders from Padme. Anakin notices this, and later hearing from Padme that he is the clone that protected her when they fell out, he requests he be specially trained for command because of him helping Padme and leading charge to hanger, Anakin wants him to lead his personal legion, the 501st. Rex being the humble man he is, wouldn’t like to talk about his heroics, and would simply brush his rank off as having been acquired by special training, even though he got that training because of what he’d done.

This would be true to both Anakin and Rex’s characters and personalities. Fits with established canon events and back stories. It would also be super easy to throw confirmation into The Bad Batch as it would only require another meet up with Rex and Omega ask him a question like “how did you become a leader?” or something. Lucasfilm Has already reconned Nik “Gramps’ Saint in Return of The Jedi to be Rex as confirmed by Rebels Finale. Also maybe that “special training” could have been part of why he was able to resist the inhibitor chip and Order 66 as he would have been already trained/programmed and would have been sent back to be trained for command, hence “special” training; maybe additional training/programming from that did something to inhibitor chip; which would have made it easier for him to resist and not kill Ahsoka. The fact that Clone Commanders have designations of CC-#### and Rex has a designation of CT-7567, lends credence to the idea that he was originally a clone trooper and not bred to be a commander/captain.

EDIT:Ok, here. Since it seems there is a lack of conensus around is Nik Saint actually Rex. I found the images I was looking for.... then I found original source: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N_KBQ-gRgxU&t=25s. That is an official Lucasfilm Chanel, video posted Jun 2019.  Look closely at times: 0:37 and 0:42, then compare to footage from RoTJ. Thats Rex's armor on Gramps. Canon is that Nik Saint is an alias, that Rex was on Endor with Han and Leia in Return of the Jedi and is the one in the storm trooper armor when they are temporarily all captured before Ewoks arrive. 

Id argue that (the video) as the official material released after RotJ, Clone Wars, and Rebels (and thus have the complete history to that point of the characters in question) depicting the events of the Battle of Endor. That the bit for bit remake of the shots from Return of the Jedi, with only the added details to turn Nik Saint into Rex, is in fact Lucasfilm's way of settling this question."

I go into a dive on what I feel would change, but more importantly what would **not** change. We have to remember that some things in the story can still play along similar lines, regardless of a deep cutting death in a theory. I feel that plays here, especially with the end of the original trilogy. For example, just as Luke's suffering pushed Vader to turn on the Emperor, I feel Luke's death could very much do the same.

400,1626900194.0,StarWarsTheories,"Theory of Omega, with a potential link to Downfall of Kamino, and the Mandalorian. - So, I've been toying with this theory for awhile, and I'm curious to hear everyones thoughts / if I've missed anything. 

At the core of my theory, I think Omega is not only a clone of Jango Fett, but has the DNA of a Jedi - perhaps the last Jedi who was protecting kamino. I believe either knowingly or unknowingly, the Kaminoans managed to extract a DNA sample from this Jedi, and with Jango Fetts DNA, began to try cloning an ultimate warrior - a force sensitive clone. 

Starting with the weakest connection in this theory - I believe this has been foreshadowed somewhat. At the start of BB episode 1, we see a Jedi being carried out by clones, and as they pass, the Jedi drops a light saber with Yellow trim. Now Omega is the only clone I know of with yellow hair, which may not be a strong connection, but it definitely opens the possibility that Jango is not the only DNA she has inside of her, as unlike any other clone she is spectacularly different.

On top of this her incredible strategic capability, along with her unnatural ability to emotionally connect with seemingly ANY individual all points to Omega having some form of force sensitivity. She knows immediately how each clone feels without them saying anything, even to the point where she just looked at Wreckers Teddy bear and knew it had emotional significance. This is not a teachable trait form the Kaminoans, if it was, then why is Omega the first to show such unbelievable promise at such an early age? 

At this point, we also have to look about how desperate the Kaminoans are to get her back, and ask why? They've kept her a secret to EVERYONE. Why so secretive? Why do they want her back if she just has some of Jango Fetts DNA, they still have that. They want her back, because she is the first force sensitive clone ever produced successfully, and they want to make more, and become a dominant force in the galaxy (and protect their own self interests). 

Now, with this theory, I believe that at the end of this season, we will see her use the force to save Hunter from almost certain death by the hands of crosshair (Or something similarly big, maybe not quite so cliche). At this point, the empire will become aware that the Kaminoans have been conducting secret cloning trials, and will in some way lead to the empire destroying Kamino. 

The knowledge on how to clone a force sensitive individual then has been hidden... Until it is rediscovered in The Mandalorian, and trials begin again, leading to Season 3/4 of the same show, where we see a new successful clone like Omega. 

So there are my thoughts so far! Written all of this on mobile, so excuse the poor grammar / writing."
401,1626817206.0,StarWarsTheories,"[Spoilers for Thrawn: Alliances] How the Grysk block out the stars - For those who don't know and ignored the spoiler warning, Thrawn: Alliances introduced a new species called the Grysk to the Star Wars universe, who seem to be canon's version of the Yuuzhan Vong. According to Thrawn himself, some stories of them say that they block out the stars with the size of their fleet, although Thrawn theorizes that they use a tactical trick to make their fleets seem bigger than they actually are. I think this trick might be that they move their homeworld (or one of its moons) around the unknown regions to use as a base. This would obviously cause it to block out the light of the stars. In Thrawn Alliances, Thrawn and Vader discover that the Grysk managed to move the moons of the planet Mokivj through hyperspace in order to block hyperspace lanes in the unknown regions. The maximum capabilities of this technology is unknown, and according to Thrawn they have a terrestrial home, but it's location is unknown. What if it's location is unknown because it keeps moving? That would explain how they keep it hidden. I'm also guessing that some sort of catastrophy marred half of their homeworld, explaining why they ritually disfigure the right half of their armor."

403,1626722639.0,StarWarsTheories,"The Identity of Snoke - This is less a theory and more my head-canon which I will hang onto unless it is explicitly stated otherwise. The evidence from this comes primarily from “The Star Wars Book” and “The Force Awakens” novelization. 

Fan speculation about the identity of Supreme Leader Snoke was rampant since the reveal of his character in The Force Awakens, and it was finally revealed in The Rise of Skywalker that he was a creation of Palpatine’s, a “strand-cast”, made to lead the First Order and train Kylo Ren in the Dark Side. 

Earlier clues to his identity came from “The Force Awakens” novelization, where it is revealed that Snoke had memories of the Rise of the Empire and the fall of the Jedi. Knowing that Snoke must have been created after Return of the Jedi, this seems to suggest that Snoke was simply a “meat puppet” controlled by Palpatine the whole time. This does not track with his personality in The Last Jedi, and is confirmed not to be true in The Star Wars Book, where it is revealed that Snoke was his own being and was likely not aware of Exegol or that he was a strand-cast. So this raises the question: how could he have remembered the Rise of the Empire?

The obvious answer to this is that he had false, implanted memory. My theory takes it a step further about where his memories came from: Snoke may have been a strand-cast created by Palpatine, but he THOUGHT he was Darth Plagueis, Palpatine’s Sith Master. In his memories he trained Palpatine in the ways of the Sith, and then was betrayed by him, but managed to survive and stay in hiding until his traitorous apprentice’s death at Endor, at which point he formed the First Order from the remnants of the Empire and determined to succeed where his apprentice had failed. In reality: the real Plagueis was killed by Palpatine and Snoke was implanted with these memories to give him purpose and personality and placed in charge of the First Order by the Sith Eternal.

There are a few other circumstantial pieces that add credence to this, such as J.J. Abrams saying that Snoke’s scars came from battle (Snoke would believe they were from when Sidious betrayed him and “tried” to kill him) and why Snoke doesn’t consider himself a Sith (his betrayal by Palpatine made him throw off the moniker). It would also be a nice nod to the primarily fan theory pre-reveal. 

TL;DR Snoke has the implanted memories of Darth Plagueis, believing himself to be Palpatine’s former master who survived his apprentice’s betrayal."

Anakin then becomes furious with the Separatists and the Jedi, and decides to fight for the Republic (aka Empire). Soon after, Palpatine declares the Jedi enemies of the Republic for refusing to fight.

I don’t know whether Gareth Edwards has confirmed their death ( I mean tbh it looks fairly obvious that they died) , but I just don’t think they did. One reason was at the end of the film, Vader was looking down at the planet and in the background there was an ‘escape pod’ or some sort of vehicle, potentially indicating that they managed to escape.

Another reason is that there’s barely any backstory about both, so to kill them off would be disappointing ( I know we’re getting a series on Andor but still xD )

However, I do believe that the storyline is better with both of them dying as it shows the sacrifice that they had to make and how they completely changed the rebellion and brought hope into the galaxy.

My brother Kevin and I were identical twins, which meant that whether through nurture of nature (hint: it was both), we developed nearly identical personalities. Collaboration was inherent — my brain developed with the understanding that Kevin’s input and involvement would be automatic. The babbling, indecipherable language my parents observed as toddlers evolved into a subconscious running dialogue. We could have entire conversations with glances, talk each other down from a crisis with a deep breath, and tell jokes with a single expression. Even after he moved the other side of the world, the unique shorthand connection between us persisted and we could have entire conversations in mere moments.

This is the story of one of those moments, one of my favorite moments with my brother.

—

I was visiting Kevin in Berlin for the first time since he had moved across the world.

As we rode the train into the city to see some sites, Kevin nodded at the hat I was wearing, which featured a white rebel starbird insignia from Star Wars.

“Forgot to ask,” he said. “Did you watch the video I sent a few weeks ago?”

“The Filoni thing about the significance of the end of Phantom Menace? Yes! I can’t believe I haven’t told you my theory about it yet!”

A few weeks earlier, a video started making the rounds on nerd blogs and message boards across the internet. In it, Dave Filoni, the producer involved in three Star Wars television series, Clone Wars, Rebels and the Mandalorian, explains how the lightsaber fight between Darth Maul and Qui-Gon Jinn at the end of the first Star Wars prequel was really about family and central to the theme of fatherhood. It was a brilliant, moving, and exceptionally nerdy, explanation. Kevin and I both adored it, and I had a theory that expanded it even further I was eager to share.

“Shoot,” Kevin said, always happy to entertain my most dorky impulses.

“Okay, here goes. Let me know if I lose you… So we know that Star Wars is modern mythology, right?” I began.

“Sure,” he replied. “Lucas relied heavily on Joseph Campbell and the monomyth. Pretty straight interpretation of the heroes’ journey when you look at it,” Kevin added, instinctively showing off a little. He wasn’t an obsessive Star Wars fan, but he knew screenwriting and could recite parts of Joseph Cambell’s seminal look at the common themes in mythology throughout history.

“Exactly,” I said. It is what I love so much about sharing Star Wars with my six year old son — they are stories for kids that talk about big and important themes in understandable ways. “And we know that the two most prominent themes in the series are family and free will, right?”

“The Filoni video makes clear that the family themes are pretty on the nose — especially the fatherhood stuff. Vader even literally means ‘father’ in dutch — doesn’t it?”

“It does,” I confirmed.

“But free will?” he asked.

“And here’s the theory that connects Star Wars with Steinbeck,” I said proudly.

“Okay, now I’m intrigued,” he said. I knew he would be.

“I’ll skip to the end and then explain how I got there,” I warned.

“Sounds unnecessarily confusing, but go on,” he said, getting impatient with the prefaces.

“Remember the scene at the end of Return of the Jedi, when Vader asks Luke to take his helmet off, so he can look at him with his own eyes, just one time?”

“I do,” he said.

“Alright, my theory boils down to what Vader says in that scene basically being thematically consistent with Adam Trask, at the end of East of Eden, saying ‘Timshel.’”

“Wow,” he said. “I really underestimated how confusing and obscure that would be. Take me through it.”

—

We first read East of Eden when we were in the same advanced placement English class in senior year of high school. It was an especially moving experience for us because our mom, who was a teacher before she had passed away years earlier due to complications with breast cancer, had taken notes when teaching the book to her high school English classes in the margins. Even though she had been gone for three years by the time we read the book, by reading the book with her margin notes, it was like we each got to read it with her.

The epic novel by John Steinbeck followed the Trask family through generations of brothers playing out the Cain and Abel dynamic, where brothers compete and conflict, as Steinbeck explores the idea of free will and if we are doomed to repeat the mistakes of past generations, or if we can choose for ourselves if we want to be good, bad, or something in between. In East of Eden, this concept was explained by a character who, when discussing the Cain and Abel story from the Bible goes into a tale about how he became obsessed with researching the word “timshel” because of how different versions of the Bible contain different translations of the word.

The character explains that when Jehovah has asked Cain why he is angry after killing his brother. Jehovah says, “If thou doest well, shall thou not be accepted? and if thou doest not well, sin lieth at the door. And unto thee shall be his desire, and thou shalt rule over him.”

It was the “thou shalt” that stuck with the character because, he explained “it was a promise that Cain would conquer sin.”

But in the a different translation of the Bible, there was a difference in the passage. In the American Standard Version, it reads, “Do thou rule over him.”

“Now this is very different,” Steinbeck had his character say. “This is not a promise, it is an order. And I began to stew about it. I wondered what the original word of the original writer had been that these very different translations could be made.”

Steinbeck’s character goes on to find out that it is the Hebrew word “timshel” that has multiple meaning-changing translations, and that how that word is interpreted — either meaning “thou shalt,” “do thou” or “thou mayest” — makes a huge difference. The following passage has always been one of my favorites in all of literature:

“Don’t you see?” he cried. “The American Standard translation orders men to triumph over sin, and you can call sin ignorance. The King James translation makes a promise in ‘Thou shalt,’ meaning that men will surely triumph over sin. But the Hebrew word, the word timshel — ‘Thou mayest’ — that gives a choice. It might be the most important word in the world. That says the way is open. That throws it right back on a man. For if ‘Thou mayest’ — it is also true that ‘Thou mayest not.’ Don’t you see?”

“Yes, I see. I do see. But you do not believe this is divine law. Why do you feel its importance?”

“Ah!” said Lee. “I’ve wanted to tell you this for a long time. I even anticipated your questions and I am well prepared. Any writing which has influenced the thinking and the lives of innumerable people is important. Now, there are many millions in their sects and churches who feel the order, ‘Do thou,’ and throw their weight into obedience. And there are millions more who feel predestination in ‘Thou shalt.’ Nothing they may do can interfere with what will be. But ‘Thou mayest’! Why, that makes a man great, that gives him stature with the gods, for in his weakness and his filth and his murder of his brother he has still the great choice. He can choose his course and fight it through and win.” Lee’s voice was a chant of triumph.

In his dying word at the end of the novel, Adam Trask tells his surviving son “timshel” — reminding him that he has the power to choose if he wants to be good or not. That people aren’t born good or bad, that we have a choice.

I re-read the book at big moments in my life. My wife and I named one of our sons “Caleb” after one of the characters in the book. I had “timshel” tattooed on my left forearm right before Caleb was born because of its significance to my son, my mom and my brother, and because of the importance I have always attached the concept explained in that one important word of East of Eden. You could say it is an important story to me.

So when Dave Filoni talked about the significance of Star Wars, the hero’s journey that Luke goes on, and the themes of good and evil, and of fathers passing down lessons to their sons, it connected with East of Eden in my head. And when I thought more about Vader’s final line at the end of Return of the Jedi to Luke, “you were right about me… tell your sister… you were right…” it made me realize that he was telling Luke the same thing that Adam Trask was telling Cal — that people aren’t good or bad — that we have the choice. Luke spent Return of the Jedi telling his father that he still sensed good in him, and Vader spent the movie saying that he didn’t have a choice but to be evil. The revelation at the end was effectively George Lucas saying “timshel” to a generation of kids who were there because of the space wizards and laser swords. And I love Star Wars for exactly that reason.

But what I love even more is that there was a short-hand my brother and I enjoyed that allowed me to, instead of diving into the more than 4,700 words of context you just read, simply say to him “Vader’s last words were telling Luke that he was right about good still existing in him, that there is a choice.”
“Ah,” he responded with a nod and a small chuckle. “Timshel. Right.”

There weren’t many people in the world, I remember thinking at the time, who could bounce between Steinbeck and Star Wars with me.

The lady sitting within an earshot of us on the train looked very confused.

413,1625689828.0,StarWarsTheories,"Theory: Omega is a clone of Sifo-Dyas - I don't think Omega's abilities that have been introduced to us thus far make her likely to be a genetic replica of Jango Fett. Fett was undoubtedly a powerful bounty hunter, and likely a brilliant strategist, but I don't believe this skillset necessarily carries over.

I am highly skeptical of the idea that she is the fifth altered clone that was referred to by Tarkin. How could she be, if she is a pure genetic replica of Jango Fett needed to continue the cloning line? I also don't believe it's Echo because he's a reg. However, The Bad Batch has taken this information entirely for granted.

I am certainly leaning toward the idea that Omega is force sensitive. I think the Kaminoans are so interested in returning her because she will be a powerful asset in their negotiations with Tarkin. I think the most plausible explanation of her being force sensitive would be a clone of Sifo-Dyas, who we learn commissioned the Kaminoans to build the clone army in Episode 2.

Alternatively, I consider it possible she is a clone of Count Dooku. I'm unsure if Tyranus ever had direct contact with the Kaminoans so I consider this possibility less likely, but still worth considering."

417,1625021125.0,StarWarsTheories,"A More Interesting Episode 9 - Watching The Last Jedi again and lamenting how good it is in comparison to The Rise of Skywalker. 

And now I will engage in the nerdiest of traditions; proposing what I believe to be a better version of a Fandom than what we were given. 

So after Rey and Kyle Ren/Ben Solo engage the Praetorian Guard, immediately after Ren/Solo kills Snoke, Ben/Kyle gives a long speech about letting the past die, specifically calling out the Jedi and the Sith. We'll come back to this because it's the main thesis of Ben/Kylo's arc through this movie and yet it is completely ignored in the next movie. By the Rise of Skywalker he's just another emperor looking to maintain his empire. All the while he undergoes this really accelerated redemption through his connection/attraction to Rey (the kiss between the two easily being the weirdest and least earned part of the movie). But as I sat there watching him tell Rey to ""let the past die, kill it if you must"" it finally dawned on me who he sounded like. 

Kreia

For those of you who played Kotor II, imagine going to talk to Kreia and this idea of ""killing the past"" sounds just like her. She wasn't looking to destroy the Sith or the Jedi, she was looking to destroy the Force itself. 

Now look at where Kylo/Ben was by the end of the Last Jedi. He had been betrayed by Luke, Snoke had used him as nothing but a pawn to get to Rey, and by extension Luke, and in what could be considered the most painful betrayal, the Force itself betrayed him, granting an insane amount of power to a nobody instead of him, the heir of Vader. 

Star Wars 9 begins with Ben Solo landing on Exegol, not as Kylo Ren, not as the Supreme Leader of the First Order, (you learn through the course of the movie he destroyed the First Order on purpose) but as Lord Trayas. Subvert the expectation with him utterly destroying the Sith Eternal culture and the reborn Palpatine. From there, its easy to create a narrative about Rey and Trayas' struggle, Trayas seeking to destroy the Force that has betrayed him at every turn and Rey seeking to preserve it. 

So thats what Star Wars 9 would have looked like had it been up to me. Thoughts?"

420,1624066034.0,StarWarsTheories,"When Rey force healed she used the dark side -revised - 1. The tragedy of darth plagueis the wise tells of a great sith capable of saving others from death but not himself.

2. In ROTS yoda says fear of loss leads to the dark side and you must except death.

3. Anakin joins the dark side to save padme from death.

4. Ben solo save Rey from death and Rey save Ben from a potentially fatal wound earlier 

5. TROS book it says Rey learned how to force heal from ancient Jedi text.

6. Anakin was denied the rank of master.

7. Jedi we’re constantly dying in the clone wars.

Force healing is clearly a dark side ability in my original theory I said there was a light aside and dark side force healing but upon rewatching the prequels and the mandolorian and criticisms of that theory I have come to the conclusion force healing is an exclusively dark side ability. First there would be no reason for the fear of loss to lead people to the dark side if the light side had the ability to save people like we saw Ben solo do in TROS. What people were constantly saying about my first theory was she learned from Jedi text, but this in fact helps my point, all other fictional wizards have books on “dark arts” in Harry Potter Hogwarts has dark arts books, in doctor strange he has dark arts books, there is zero reason to believe the Jedi wouldn’t have text about sith and there abilities in fact the Jedi not giving anakin rank of master makes more sense if you think they had sith text only allowed to masters, this could have even been the reason anakin wanted master. In the madalorian season one we saw grogu force heal around the the time he tried to use force choke and the next season we they meat with Ahsoka and she says he has to much fear in him and she would not train him because she had seen what it had done to someone else, force healing for grogu would be a temptation to the dark side. Finally there’s the biggest piece of evidence Palpatine comes out and says the tragedy of darth plagueis the wise could save people from death which would be force healing. Force healing is exclusively a dark side ability."

Second, if we know the force allows people to survive more than they normally could, take Anakin Skywalker for example, he survived falling into lava and having all his limbs cut off, and he survived, so I think a Jedi master could survive a fall.

Third, Windu didn't loose any vital organs or body parts, he just lost his hand which is very common in Star Wars."
423,1623861414.0,StarWarsTheories,"The True Purpose of the Jedi Order - I have a theory based on observation of effect. Basically I've learned to listen less to people and watch more of what they do. In macro situations, particularly where the motive, modus operandi, and/or operator are unclear, I look to the effect to understand who could have benefitted and then extrapolate their motive and means.

This brings me to the founding of of Jedi Order...naturally. I have a theory that the true purpose of the Jedi Order and indeed the reason for its inception is entirely to control and mitigate the damage and numbers of force sensitive individuals throughout the galaxy. We've seen that a single force sensitive indivual can affect massive change in the galaxy. That change is often damaging and causes much collateral damage. Hence the Jedi codes and rules of conduct do everything short of lobotomizing force sensitives in order to limit their effect on the world around them. They teach the repression of emotion and they limit their learning constantly. They closely guard all manner of knowledge related to the Force. 

We also know that force sensitivity is more often than not hereditary. A mainstay of the rules of the Jedi is not to love or marry and thus have no children. The Jedi seek out any force sensitives they can and induct them into the order using all but force to do so. Force being the one thing they cannot use since their purpose is to prevent exactly that kind of behavior. Their induction of as many as possible, coupled with their being essentially forbidden from having children has the intended effect of limiting the number of force sensitives running around out there. Of course, whomever came up with the idea likely knew they would never be able to induct all force sensitives, that was never the goal. 

The goal was never to ""eliminate"" the threat posed by these magic people because that goal would be unattainable. Instead the goal was merely to ""mitigate"" and, where possible, control the threat. So why choose to use and teach these very dangerous people? Well, if you can indoctrinate people into thinking that what you want them to do is the good and proper thing, then you create a self-sustaining cycle of cultists ready and able to police their own. In effect, they defeat and shackle themselves to the very goal you intended, but that they aren't necessarily fully aware of. 

This brings me to the Sith. The sith code states, ""Peace is a lie, there is only passion. Through passion, I gain strength. Through strength, I gain power. Through power, I gain victory. Through victory, my chains are broken. The Force shall free me."" It makes me wonder as to whether the Sith are actually right. Objectively the Sith characters we see in most media, and definitely the movies, are malicious and filled with only hate. But, intellectually, I have to examine the logic.

The line ""Peace is a lie, there is only passion,"" most people interpret that as one bit. Meaning they take it to mean that the Jedi practice of repression one's emotions is wrong, but that's not what it says. It says ""Peace is a lie..."" What if that sentence has two meanings? The first bit, by itself, referring not to the practice of Jedi, but the goal of institution...or at least the motive behind its inception. The second meaning being to take it as a whole that to repress one's self is wrong. In this way, the Sith would be directly calling out the insidious nature of the Jedi Order. 

The second bit, ""through passion, I gain strength,"" is interesting in the sense that to deny one's emotions is to deny one's self. In this way the Jedi actively deny themselves and ignore, much less understand, who they are. We here in the real have long held the belief that to understand one's self gives us strength. There is an ancient Greek inscription on the temple of Apollo that basically translates to ""know thyself and thou shalt know all the secrets of the gods and of the universe."" This is just an eloquent way of saying that to know and accept yourself gives you power. The Jedi deny themselves this, and thus is makes them weak. The Sith understand this. 

I'm less interested in the middle bits as it's really just logical stepping stones to the last. ""Through victory, my chains are broken. The Force shall free me."" I said before that the Jedi unwittingly shackle themselves to the covert purpose of their Order's mastermind whomever that was. I believe the Sith understand this and thus they know they have been shackled and upon this revelation is where they accept and begin the path of the Sith Code, the end goal of which is to break those shackles and gain their freedom. 

So what do YOU think? Are the Jedi really just a cult of unwitting pawns in a master's game of keeping them in check? Are the Sith right, or are the Jedi really just peaceful do-gooders galavanting around with deadly weapons?"

427,1623430190.0,StarWarsTheories,"A follow-up post from yesterday; Joruus C'Baoth and amendments to my post from yesterday - Spoilers for today's BB episode & the OG Thrawn Trilogy.

I just want to say this episode was amazing. Even though Rex is a bit overrated in my opinion, I loved seeing him return and helping the Bad Batch with their inhibitor chips. An aspect of theory from yesterday turned out to be wrong; it was Rex, not Bel Iblis. As someone pointed out to me yesterday, Saw Guerra causes havoc in the rebellion in the new canon. However, he unfortunately doesn't make it past Rogue One. To be fair, I'm not expecting Bel Iblis in the Bad Batch anymore, unless there comes much more Rebellion stuff. My conclusion to the Bel Iblis theory is that:

1. Bel gets introduced in Andor as a halfhearted ally who eventually leaves the Rebellion due to Mon Mothma. This could make Mon Mothma more interesting, as by this time she caused two important persons to leave the Rebellion as an organisation. This would continue my theory from yesterday.

2. Bel doesn't become canon. As simple as that. I'd be very sad, but the odds of Bel becoming canon aren't very high. In case Bel doesn't become canon, I want Ackbar to face off against Thrawn in a big space battle.

Another small mention: Noghri should be introduced as a species like in the books, and have Rukh (Rebels) be an analomy.


Now, on to Joruus. This theory is farfetched, but I think it'd be pretty neat. So the Bad Batch is probably going to lead into the Kaminoan uprising. I suggest having a small crew of Kaminoans escape with the Spaarti cylinders of the Kamino facility, together with the vital cloning equipment and a dead Jedi's body. They strand in the Unknown Regions, possibly a planet called 'Wayland' (referencing to the OG Thrawn Trilogy). They get help from some local human/species to set up a small bunker, and the Kaminoans use the dead body, which they kept in a cooler to preserve the DNA and the midichlorians, and try to make a clone of the Jedi with the DNA, as a protector for them against the dangers of the planet and possible intruders. 

Sadly, due to the cloning equipment far from perfect and the technology still brand new (possibly Omega in the Bad Batch?) the clone of Jorus is mentally unstable and kills the Kaminoans, only to take control of Wayland and controlling the minds of the civillians. 

Thrawn would find out about the cloning equipment for his army either during his absence after Rebels when he and Ezra got blasted into the Unknown Regions, and would, in this way, meet Joruus. If Ezra and Thrawn are together, Joruus could try to kill Ezra, cutting off his arm, as Thrawn promises him the Skywalkers, but Thrawn makes Joruus spare Ezra due to some 'debt' in their adventures together. Thrawn is a villan, but one with honor and respect for his enemies. Thrawn proceeds to try and overthrow the New Republic, while Joruus hunts for the Skywalkers. Ashoka and Sabine would find Ezra, and this all would lead to a showdown with Luke, Mara, Ashoka, Ezra and Leia versus Joruus and Ezraa, instead of Luuke. Due to the Vader comics there is no feasible way to get Luke's hand near Thrawn or Joruus. Joruus, Ezraa and Ezra himself die in the battle. Thrawn gets defeated and Pellaeon flees with the Imperial Remnant to the Unknown Regions. Ashoka would proceed to train Grogu, while Luke trains Mara and starts gathering resources for his acadamy.

I discussed a theory about Luuke showing up around 15 years after Ep 6 with u/Amhara1, which would explain (to an extent) the BeAuTiFuL wAy mY eXpEcTaTiOnS wERe sUbvERtED iN eP8 WiTh LuKe SkYwAlkER.

429,1623372599.0,StarWarsTheories,"Darth Vader spared Grogu - Does it sound dumb or unbelievable?

Yes, especially considering that he hacked apart younglings and the whole Tusken Raider village. 

But hear me out.

In the original trilogy one of the themes was that Luke believed that there was some good in Vader. That even after all of those years, deep down, underneath that armor and cybernetics was Anakin. 

He was right. 

Now let’s talk about Anakin’s path toward evil. 

Anakin never seemed to be someone who set out to do evil things. Yes, the Tusken Raider village was awful and unforgivable, but this was more or so an emotionally/mentally unstable young man in very upsetting circumstances.

The same goes for killing Mace Windu. He didn’t plan on doing that. He was just in a crazy situation, having to choose between the man he believed could save his wife or the man who made him obey repressive rules his whole life, tells him that he needs to make an exception for himself... in order to kill the man who he believed could save his wife. 

What would you do?

He was evil, but these acts were more or so out of impulse and bad situations.

Palpatine is a whole other kind of evil. He just wants to rule over everyone, and he loves nothing. The people closest to him are just pawns for him to throw under the bus. 

They’re both bad, but what would you say is worse? 

A guy who murdered out of impulse in an unexpected and highly upsetting situation or the guy who planned a murder, thought about it for months, and then enjoyed committing the murder?

Both are bad, but on different levels. 

Now let’s get to the raid on the Jedi temple.

It’s Darth Vader’s first act of premeditated evil. He’s going in there with the plan to kill a bunch of people.

Vader was a killer, but a spur of the moment killer up to that point. Since we know that there was always a bit of good in him the whole time, it’s believable that he could have his reservations. 

Still, he goes ahead and, well, you know the rest. 

“Master Skywalker...”

He slaughtered a bunch of kids, so why would Grogu be any different?

It’s not because Grogu is adorable. 

It’s how he communicates. 

In The Mandalorian, Ahsoka says that she and Grogu can “feel each other’s thoughts.” 

I think that Darth Vader was about to kill Grogu after going through the other younglings until Grogu reached out to him through the force. 

They could *feel* each other’s thoughts. 

Grogu could have felt the pain that Vader went through his whole life. Not just talk to and empathize, but literally feel this pain and understand it completely. 

It was the most pure, unrefined empathy that Vader had ever felt. Someone didn’t just picture themselves in his shoes, they felt what it was like. 

Grogu might have gone a step further and could have reached out to Anakin, since in ROTJ, it was confirmed that there was always good in him. 

The rest?

Maybe a few clones step into the room, they’re about to fire on Grogu, and then Vader kills them all, keeping it a secret (like a homage to Force Unleashed). 

The only other person who saw the good in Vader?

Luke.

It’s like poetry, it rhymes. 

While training under Luke, Grogu shares this memory of how his father still had good in him, even early on in his fall to the dark side. This strengthens Luke’s faith in the Jedi way and the force, making him more driven to bring back the order. 

TL;DR - Darth Vader spared Grogu because Grogu could communicate through the force, fully understanding his pain, and even reach out to Anakin."
430,1623316315.0,StarWarsTheories,"The battle at Bilbingri from the Original Thrawn Triology will take place in some form - Hey everyone! I hope you all are having a great day! I wanted to present a couple of linking theories, to do with the Bad Batch, Andor, Ashoka, S3 and S4 of the Mandolorian, Book Of Boba Fett and the original Thrawn Triology.

Bad Batch: The Hologram at the end of Ep6 S1

I've seen a lot of theories about this, and the most vocal ones are Rex, Organa or Fulcrum. If it's gonna be any of these, I'm putting my money on Bail Organa. But I have a new suggestion, Bel Iblis from the legends Thrawn Triology. Bel Iblis was a millitary genius, and helped set up the rebellion with Bail and Mon Mothma after the Clone Wars. Due to conflict between Bel Iblis and Mon Mothma, Bel left the rebellion to start a mercenary faction, to protect people against the empire. This conflict was caused by Mon Mothma who keep channeling more power to herself, and Bel wasn't okay with this. His appearance in the BB could show how Mon, Bail and Bel set up the Rebellion.

Andor: Bel Iblis

As Andor's release next year is coming closer, we get more set leaks and info about the show. To my knowledge it will be about Andor (duh) a couple of years prior to Rogue One, and with missions for the rebellion and all that. What would be a better show than Andor to explore the conflict of power in the higherups? As explained in the part about the BB, Bel Iblis eventually left the rebellion. The series Andor could have both action and a lot of political conflict within the Rebellion at the same time. Bel Iblis would leave the Rebellion with his men and ships at the end of the first season (or the second, idk which), leaving the Rebellion with a lot less resources, allowing for a plot for the next season where the rebels need to steal from Imperial Shipyards etc.

Book Of Boba Fett:

When thinking of the Criminal Underworld, 2 names pop instantly to my mind: Talon Karrde and Mara Jade. Talon Karrde was a smuggler and had built a big network. Mara was his righthand(wo)man. These characters were pivital to the eventual defeat of Thrawn. They could be introduced as buisnesscontacts/friends of Boba. This could happen through a meeting as set up by Talon in the book 'The Last Command', asking his underworld friends for help to defeat Thrawn.

Ashoka and Mandalorian S3 & S4 and possibly Rangers OTNR: 

It's obvious these series are gonna have some big final finale, possibly leading to the creation of the First Order. I'm not a fan of the sequels, but if Dave and Favreau can create very good stories to fill the plotholes, then I'm all for it. The big bad for this finale is gonna be more or less Thrawn. One of the main reasons why I want Bel Iblis to be canon so badly is because I don't want Thrawn to be defeated in 1 on 1 combat. It doesn't fit his character and wouldn't make for a high-stakes ending. Ezra, Ashoka and maybe even Luke should fight the darktroopers or something more sinister like a certain Dark Jedi. (I have theories of Joruus C'Baoth as well, but I'll make another post later) I want Thrawn to be defeated in a space battle, like at Bilbingri in the books. One opponent who could match Thrawn in terms of military genius is Bel Iblis. I'd love to see a dynamic between these completely opposite characters with insane skills.

Thank you for reading and may the force be with you all :)"
431,1623254148.0,StarWarsTheories,"Who was in the Hologram? [SPOILER] - I have heard many theories about the identity of the person Rafa and Trace spoke to at the end of the last Bad Batch Episode. The theories range from Ahsoka to Saw however I have reasons to believe and not to believe most of them, starting with the most unlikely for me.

**Ahsoka** : The sisters refered to their employer as ""he"". Case closed.

**Kenobi** : Obi Wan was ordered by Yoda to go into hiding at this point and watch over Luke Skywalker. It is highly unlikely that Kenobi will ever leave Tatooine until A New Hope.

**Captain Rex** : Rex being the employer is also unlikely for some huge reasons. Why would Rex want tactical droid information to help him learn how to kill more Clones? To add to this, why would Rex want data about clone strategies he may know himself already? Besides, Rex is likely more focused on helping his brothers defeat the inhibitor chips rather than starting a Rebellion like Saw Guerra.

**Saw Guerra** : This one is likely because we have already seen Saw preparing for a rebellion on his home planet and had already escaped by the time Crosshair came to kill him. Saw could be anywhere doing anything and may be trying to get access to tactical droid information. However, the man in the picture has a robe or cloak, not something Saw Guerra would be seen wearing very often. I will admit that my argument against that theory has no legs to stand on however.

**Maul** : There are two separate theories I have for this. Many people assume that he is about to get cracking on his crime syndicate, however it is possible that Maul may be planning a rebellion to spite Sidious and destroy his Young Empire. It is also possible that Maul is indeed starting his life in the Crime underworld, something Trace and Rafa are involved in to an extent. It is certainly possible that he fooled the girls into joining his syndicate and is just flat out lying to them, however this doesn't explain why he needs tactical droid intel. 

**Bail Organa** : This is my favourite theory. We all know Organa started the rebellion, he saved at least two Jedi during Order 66 and maybe more, he spent much of the time before the battle of Yavin funding the rebellion. To add to this, the cloak in the Hologram is very similar to Bail Organa's robes. It would also make sense why Bail Organa needs intel on Clone tactics because he was never a military leader and wasn't aware of clone movements, and he also has a valid reason to be killing clones. Ultimately, I can't find any reason why it wouldn't be Bail Organa."
432,1623210617.0,StarWarsTheories,"The Deaths of the Bad Batchers - Just a little thought I had regarding the fate of the Bad Batch. I can easily see this series panning out to be a Halo: Reach-esque tale of a team heroically sacrificing themselves one by one as time goes on. However, I don't believe all of the batchers will be killed off since it seems like a lot of prequel characters are being written to survive past RoTJ.

Anyways, I think Tech (tick hehe) will be the first to bite the dust. Echo is already a similar counterpart to him and I don't think he would be killed off immediately given his status as a fan favorite character that already ""died"" once. Tech's death would set back the team significantly in terms of intelligence and technological prowess. The rest of the team would have to acclimate to not having Tech around to save their butts by finding problems with the ship or creating fake IDs, etc.

From there, I'm not really sure. I feel like Wrecker will go out in some huge explosive way since it's fitting for his character. Depending on how many seasons the show runs, I can easily see Tech being killed at the end of this season and Wrecker much later on.

Echo is a character on a level comparable to Rex yet was never seen or mentioned in Rebels. Maybe he never linked up with Rex, or maybe he dies. Who knows.

I believe Hunter has a fair chance of making it through the end given his status as a father figure to Omega. Although, if the showrunners really wanna pull at the heartstrings, Omega witnessing his death would be absolutely devastating.

Not sure about Crosshair. He could probably tell the grim reaper to fuck off directly and live to see the saga, or he might hit his head on a doorframe and incur a sever concussion."
433,1623089758.0,StarWarsTheories,"STORMTROOPERS DON'T HAVE BAD AIM - We all make fun of how the stormtroopers can not hit a single thing. But I have a theory that debunks that and states that the troopers are just simply not trying because Darth Vader wants the rebels alive. 

First lets look at A New Hope the Stormtroopers were trying to shoot the rebels and not get shot themselves but that still doesn't show Vader wanted them alive. Earlier in the movie on The Tantive IV Darth Vaders says "" Tear this ship apart until you find those plans and bring me the passengers I want them alive."" Why he wanted then alive well most likely because as we know from Leia's interegation he wants to know where the Hidden Rebel Base is. This leads us to Han and Luke he would not know they are not with the rebels yet so he would still want them alive to know where that base is. 

Now to Empire Strikes Back in Empire we know Vader wants Luke to join him or get the Han in carbonite treatment so we know he don't want Luke dead. When an officer tells Vader that the Falcon was most likely destroyed by an asteroid Vader tells him that they are alive and to find the ship implying that he was not satisfied by the possibility of there death. The scene in Bespin when  Vader tells Lando to take Chewie and Leia to his ship also shows that he didn't want them to die and to just come with him. 

Finally Return of the Jedi  well in Jedi when they take him hostage and Vader just wants to take a stroll down the hallway with luke not harm him and in their climactic lightsaber battle Vader can not bare to watch his son in pain while yes this is the return of Anakin he was not fully turned till be kills Palps Vader also doesn't go as Hardcore as he did before knowing he was his father. As for Han, Lando, and Leia he probably wants Lando to finish him himself cause Calrissian betrayed him and did not take Leia and the Wookie to his ship and as important rebel leaders Vader will  want Han and Leia as Hostages so he told his Troopers to try not to kill them."

435,1623055843.0,StarWarsTheories,"Rey is Sabé's descendant, possibly a granddaughter. - Okay, so, we all know she is Palpatine's granddaughter, yada yada, failed clone, things and all. 

But since I watched TFA, I couldn't shake it how much Daisy Ridley just looks a lot like Keira Knightly, who played Sabé, Queen Padmé's decoy in TPM. Not just ""same hair colour and skin tone"" but enough to play sisters in a film. 

It's not just their hair colour and general whiteness, but they have basically the same or very similar features, like their smiles, facial bone structure, body structure, exact same height (1.7m/5 ft 7), body type, voices...

They look as alike as Natalie Portman and Knightly do now, maybe more 

Now hear me out, what if Rey and Sabé are related by Rey's mother?

Canonically, Padmé was born in 46 BBY, and Sabé (who was formely named Tsabin, according to the internet) was also born in the same year, so they were both 14 in TPM. 

Rey was born in 15 ABY, 61 years later. 
To those who don't remember, Jodie Comer is the actress who plays Rey's mother in the flashback and is 28 now (2021). If we go with that age for the character and subtract the time for the film being filmed in 2018, her birth would be placed in 10 BBC, which means Sabé would be 36 at the time: Completely plausible and very interesting. 

I heard there's some sort of project with Sabé in the future for SW and that's a nice theory that would give Rey and her parents a more solid backstory, specially her mother."
436,1623022666.0,StarWarsTheories,"How do clone numbers work? - We know that there were well over a million clones made throughout the clone wars. But their identification only allows them to be numbered up to 9,999 (CT-XXXX). Even if the numbers rotate, there were certainly more than 9,999 active at any given time during the clone wars. Were there repeats based on different points of deployment? How does this work? I’d love to hear some theories!"
437,1623007526.0,StarWarsTheories,"Theory: The Martez Sisters are working for Maul, who is hunting The Bad Batch - When we are introduced to the Martez Sisters, they were spice running for Crimson Dawn. It's safe to assume they would still be working for the crime syndicate since we last saw them. Fennec Shand's employer at the moment is unknown, but I think it's Maul. Why? Because somehow, Maul heard about The Bad Batch, and that they fought alongside Obi Wan Kenobi. I think Maul thinks they know where Kenobi is, so he hired a bounty hunter to track them down and capture them. He wanted Fennec to capture Omega as bait, so she can capture the rest of The Bad Batch, where he will interrogate them and hunt and kill his old nemesis."
438,1622931252.0,StarWarsTheories,"Has there ever been a non force user with a robot arm or hand? - I was watching the bad batch and was wondering why echo doesn’t have a robot hand like Luke and Anakin had. 

I started thinking and I couldn’t think of any people in the universe who have robot arms and aren’t force users. So I’m wondering if there’s any character Im unaware of who isn’t force sensitive and has a robot arm."
439,1622875197.0,StarWarsTheories,"Jedi and Sith (Lore) - Abit of a question for lore nerdies out there
I like to pride myself that i know alot of the lore but there are some things i dont know. So heres my question:-

Has there ever been a time where the Jedi and the Sith ever fought together? Like a situation where its that dire, both sides has set aside their differences for the good of the Galaxy?"
440,1622823688.0,StarWarsTheories,"Did Palpatine take it easy on Windu? - There used to be debate over whether or not Palpatine planned to be defeated by Windu so Anakin would save him, however George Lucas came along and said Palpatine lost fair and square.

Another point I saw recently was that Palpatine intentionally took it easy on Windu before Anakin's arrival so he could demonstrate his power to Anakin, then he underestimated Windu and got himself beaten.

What do you think?

Could Palpatine have killed Windu in a second and was merely toying with him before getting too complacent and losing?

Or was Windu genuinely Palpatine's match and defeated him fair and square?"
441,1622818058.0,StarWarsTheories,"The Martez sisters are working for Crimson Dawn - At the end of the most recent episode of the bad batch, they come across the Martinez sisters, who informed them that they'll give the information on someone to fight the empire. 

Obviously your first thought is meant to be the rebellion, but they haven't formed yet, at least not in any significant way. And after that hologram at the end... It's definitely Maul.

Last we saw them they were in dept to the crime syndicate... So it would make sense that they are still trying to repay that dept. And as we all know, Maul is no fan of the Sith... So why wouldn't he be trying to fight back? 

Let me know what you guys think."
442,1622500281.0,StarWarsTheories,"Death Star Safety Railings... - ...that are force fields. The hallways and crew areas that apparently have no railing are really protected by force fields. [I made this video to illustrate.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pts5Uut_sLM)

A force field, unlike a regular railing, protects the person from heat and radiation, as well as protects staff if there is damage or an accident that causes internal explosions.

Finally, the people who push the button on the Super Laser might hesitate to execute the destruction of a planet. Being trapped at their work station ensures their loyalty."
443,1622419833.0,StarWarsTheories,"The Bad Batch Episode 5. Cid is hiding a Holocron - Hey everyone,

I was making a breakdown video and while going through all the Easter eggs I noticed a blacked out box with a hint of red.

When we see a close up of cid, the item is completely blacked out 

After enhancing the image you can see a red design similar to what a holocron would have.

I think this holocron will be in Omega’s possession in the future.

I have images of the item on my video if you would like to take a look.

444,1622337643.0,StarWarsTheories,"Cad Bane and Boba Fett in Bad Batch - The mystery of who hired Fennec Shand is simple, it was probably either Lama Su or Nala Se. But they wouldn't hire just any bounty hunter, especially one so new and unproven like Shand. They would want the best, Cad Bane. Cad Bane probably brought Fennec onboard like how Jango used Zam Wessel in Episode 2. Bane probably  would have a group of bounty hunters with him like Boba, Bossk, etc.

The Bounty Hunters would be working for the Kaminoans, not the Empire. This could be a possible reason Fennec Shand she was wanted by the ISB in The Mandalorian. They could also have been brought in for an additional reason. If the Kaminoans have a rebellion like in Legends, they would hire a new set of Bounty Hunters to train their new batches in secret. 

Another plot thread I can see is a mentor/student relationship with Bane and Boba. It would probably end like it does in the unfinished clone wars episodes where they both have a shootout with Bane dying and Boba getting his helmet dented. A possible rift between the 2 of them would be Bane working against the Empire while would be more loyal to it (because them killing the Jedi or something). Or maybe Boba has a moment of connection with Omega that makes him switch sides (although he doesn't seem to like other clones)."
445,1622331072.0,StarWarsTheories,"Rey's true heritage - OK, hear me out on this one. So, Rey's dad has been known for a while to be a Strandcast (artificial creation) from Palpatine's genetic template. The Wookieepedia page for bioengineering says that it is ""the science of altering the genes of a species to produce a desired result"". Notice that it says ""altering"", not ""creating"".

With the recent revelation in Darth Vader #11 about Luke's hand, it begins to make me wonder: was Rey's father a combination of Luke *and* Palpatine's genes? This would make Rey both a Skywalker and a Palpatine biologically, and may explain her power. Using both Palpatine and Luke? Her midichlorian counts would be off the charts!

There's only one problem with this theory: the kiss at the end of TROS. If this theory is true, then the kiss would be... incest. I'm not sure if that's where Disney would like to take the story. That's all though."
446,1622324125.0,StarWarsTheories,"Shaak Ti’s meditation saved countless Jedi during Order 66 - Shaak Ti was present during the attack on the Jedi temple during Order 66. In the Star Wars 2015 comic series, there is a recording of Shaak Ti sending a message to future generations of Jedi about her imminent death and the Order’s destruction. If she knew the Temple was lost, she would probably try to save the Jedi another way. In a deleted scene from Episode 3, she is seen meditating in the temple before she is impaled by Anakin. What if her meditation was not her being caught unprepared but instead it was her using the force to send a warning to the other Jedi across the galaxy. Her message combined with the deaths of all the Jedi in the temple is likely what Jedi like Yoda, Ahsoka, Depa Billaba, and Jaro Tapal felt right before their clones turned."
447,1622013356.0,StarWarsTheories,"Why Fennec Shand will become an ally to the Bad Batch - I made a video about why I think Fennec Shand will become an ally to the Bad Batch, so you can check out the video in the link below. But the gist of the theory is that in Mando S2, Fennec Shand briefly mentioned that she was wanted by the ISB, so the reason why I believe Fennec was put on the ISB's wanted list is because she helped the Bad Batch in their struggle against the Galactic Empire. Maybe she helped them avoid Imperial troops, or maybe she helped hide Omega (cause we all know that the Empire is eventually gonna find out about Omega), but the point to take away is that Filoni and Favreau intentionally put that line about Fennec Shand being wanted by the ISB in Mando Season 2 so that it could pay off in The Bad Batch.

448,1621989445.0,StarWarsTheories,"The Obi Wan vs Grievous fight didn’t matter. - For Palpatine, whatever happens in this fight doesn’t matter. All that Palpatine needs is for Obi Wan to be separated from Anakin. If Grievous survives, it doesn’t matter. Palpatine would send Vader to kill him later. If Obi Wan dies, it only pushes Anakin closer to the Dark Side. 

In the movie, Palpatine reveals himself to Anakin when he is told that Obi Wan has engaged Grievous, not that Grievous is destroyed. So he did this without knowing who would win. It must not have mattered that much in the long term.


Palpatine knew the Jedi were using Anakin to spy on him. So he reveals Grievous’ location to the Jedi to distract them. The Council predictably sends Obi Wan because he has the most experience with Grievous. Anakin is now isolated, pressured, and desperate. He fears his wife will die, he lost his faith in the Jedi, and he only trusts Palpatine to help him."
449,1621734638.0,StarWarsTheories,"New starkiller that used asoka's lightsabers - Spoilers for the ending of clone wars,
If you remember asoka leaves her two lightsabers, that anikin turned blue somehow, at the end of clone wars at the wreck, then darth vader is shown to find the wreck.

Who else is know fpr using two blue light sabers?
Starkuller from the force unleashed.

As we all know dave is a genius, so it's not too far fetched to asume that he'd create a new version of starkiller for a show or spin off film. 

Wouldn't it be really cool to see said hypothetical starkiller get asokas lightsabers from vader?!
Atleast it would be very cool. 

Perhabs that's why they switched asokas saber to blue in the first place.

I'd like to know your guys though on it."
450,1621679274.0,StarWarsTheories,"Anakin Brought Balance To The Force - Sorry if there's something I'm missing from some hidden canon or something. Let me know what you guys think.

I believe that the force is constantly trying to balance itself between the dark and the light sides. I believe that the entire power levels of the light and the dark side are the same. I don't mean that all force users have the same amount of power, I think when there are powerful force users it just means that there are some users elsewhere that aren't as powerful. What that means is with more light side users the amount of power each of them has is diminished overall. That's why the Sith are almost always more powerful, because there's less of them and that's why apprentices are always trying to kill their masters, to gain more power. 

At the time of Anakin's birth, there were probably hundreds if not thousands of Jedi, light side users, and the force itself tried to correct this by making Anakin. It made sure, not consciously mind you, I don't think the force is a conscious entity, that Anakin wouldnt be found by the Jedi as easily as other younglings. However he was accidentally found, a child who had an insanely high aptitude for force abilities. I think this intrigued Qui-Gon so much because some in the Order, him included, knew that the Jedi weren't as strong as the once were.

Flash forward to when Anakin is complicit in Order 66, where he himself kills light side users. I believe it was this act that ultimately brought a kind of balance to the force, leveling out the level of light side users, the Jedi, to a similar number to that of the dark side users, the Sith.

This theory about the force also explains why Rey is so powerful in the new trilogy, because she is one of likely only a handful of light side users in the galaxy - at least ones still connected to the force. Other Jedi who survived might have done what Like did and cut themselves off from the force ultimately loosening up more power which she was then able to tap into. Kylo probably couldn't ever have become extremely powerful in the dark side because of Smoke and the Emperor was being alive and hoarding all the dark side power."
451,1621583283.0,StarWarsTheories,"(SPOILERS) Omega's connection to the Force - Well yep here it is, another Omega fan theory, shock horror!

Lets just get to it already.

We've established that Omega is a defective Clone. Doesnt take an idiot to work that one out. Tarkin even says it himself. The 5 super clones that has super mutated genes within their gene codes. This doesnt count Echo, (watch the clone wars) he is practically rebuilt, half clone, half machine.

We know what Hunter, Tech, Wrecker and Crosshairs super abilities are. But what of Omega? Well, its simple, she is force sensitive and the first clone to be force sensitive.

Why is the Empire so interested in her? Because of her genetic code. Palpatine needs her genetic code so he can clone himself and cheat death. 

Now, i dont know if this is a spoiler but this makes incredible sense to me given that its what we established in Episode 9 Rise of Skywalker. 

Is her being force sensitive a fluke? Nope! Its the force, it works in mysterious ways that not even the most powerful Jedi/Sith can explain. It just happens. 

In a way im hoping im wrong so i can be super shocked, but as i said, it makes incredible sense to me. At the moment there is no evidence as far as i can tell because she hasnt used the force, but she is developiny emotions for 99 squad, so could something potentially happen to them which could prompt her to use the force in anger? 

Since a high ranking officer such as Tarkin is involved, it could also mean the Sith Inquisitors could be aswell. Seeing them in action outaide the travesty that is Rebels and the masterpiece that is Jedi Fallen Order would be sublime. The Inquisitors has always interested me. And since the events of BB happens directly after the downfall of the Jedi Order, then no doubt Vader will be training a few of them up. 

Let me know what you think! I need plotholes and answers!"
452,1621483320.0,StarWarsTheories,"Palpatine didn't siphoned Padme's lifeforce to Anakin, Anakin subconsciously did it with the will of Padme's to help Anakin. - Somehow I couldn't find anything on reddit or even in bigger theories about this, which is weird because it feels so natural.

Apparently a strong theory about why Padme died is that Palpatine siphoned her lifeforce to keep Anakin alive. But this never seemed to be remotely possible for a user of the force to transfer lifeforce from one person to an other (unless they are personally part of the exchange). Not only that, but Palpatine was far from Padme, both physically (obviously) and emotionally. They had no real connections other than both being politician acquaintance.

So my theory is that Anakin, having a strong emotional bond with Padme, actually subconsciously siphoned Padme's lifeforce in an attempt to stay alive. The dark force tried to find a way to keep himself alive, which is in theme with the selfishness nature of the dark force. Padme also wanted to save Anakin, saying there was still good in him. This will to save him would just facilitate the transfer.

This is illustrate by both scene of Padme slowly dying has she gives birth and Anakin healing as he is being ""repaired"" playing simultaneously.

I am not a huge SW fan, so this theory most likely already exist, but I don't know all the resources and where said theory could be found and discussed. If you know of said thread feel free to share!"
453,1621444435.0,StarWarsTheories,"alternate timeline where Anakin dies -  

Obi-wan kills Anakin fully like dead in my new timeline and luke and Leia went with Yoda to Dagobah to Train and rebuild the Jedi order obi-wan is being hunted by the galactic empire. All well Palpatine is looking for a new Apprentice 

Obi wan has so much hate toward Palpatine and Yoda. He would do anything to protect Luke and Leia. He has mastered all lightsaber combat and has unlocked his full potential in the force. He isn't a jedi anymore, he only wants revenge.  

Leia is just a follower. She does what luke is; she only wants to be a jedi because luke does. She is more powerful than Luke in the force but lacks in lightsaber combat. 

Luke is very Talented in lightsaber combat and the force he is very Arrogant and disobeys Yoda and Always Drives to be more powerful than him although he respects his Knowledge in the force. 

Yoda is overwhelmed with Luke and Leia wishing that Obi-Wan would come and help train them so they can beat Palpatine and get rid of the sith forever.

454,1621391135.0,StarWarsTheories,"“Darth” Jar Jar isn’t actually evil - Yes, it’s another Darth Jar Jar post. But let me bring a different idea to the table. 

I find it quite sus that Jar Jar is able to suddenly rise to power despite being clumsy and unintelligent. But I think I figured it out. He was being manipulated by higher powers into becoming a general, then a senator. As an idiot, higher powers like palpatine found him very useful to manipulate, give him power and get him to do their bidding. 

“Jar Jar is the key to all this”... in the first movie Jar Jar was the key to unifying the Naboo and the Gungans. Question is, who benefited from this union? Padme? She certainly won over both her people and the gungans. Maybe Dooku? Maybe he wanted to stop the blockade to screw over the trade federation so that he would have more power over the separatists? 

Holy f*cking hell, I need to take off the tin foil hat."

457,1621153861.0,StarWarsTheories,"Bad Batch Season story theory - Hi this is my first time posting here so here it goes...

I watched an awsome YT channel called Star Wars Only's livestream yesterday where they talked  about the Bad Batch having multiple series and the character of Omega. The YTer's GF  (known as Ms only) theorises that rather than being force sensitive Omega has all the Bad Batch abilities... so going off of her theory...

 I believe there will be another season, but I reckon (from Ms only theory of Omega having all the abilities of the bad batch)  that the caminoans (before the whole order 66 thing) was testing to get the perfect clone, but once the order 66 and slowly fading the clones, they were  hiding her from the Empire to create a secret clone army to revolt against them (caminoan rebellion plotline). 

I believe the Empire will find out about it and wants her dna as a template for the elite squad and  their focus will shift to capturing Omega rather than hunting the Bad Batch. I also believe that  at the end of s1 she will be captured by the Empire (like how they did it with Grogu in Mando s1)  and season 2 of the Bad Batch will be about them rescuing Omega from the empire.

what you all think? Good, Meh or rubbish? I like theorising on SW but never to anyone so publicly 🤣"
458,1621040585.0,StarWarsTheories,"1,000 Jedi and 0 Sith = balance - I was rewatching the phantom menace and thinking about some it’s criticisms, specifically mitichlorians (I might have spelled that wrong, please correct me if I did), so I started to think about how the force works, which made me think about one of my previous theories, anyone can have Jedi reflexes, in that theory I come to the conclusion that because the force surrounds everyone/thing anyone can feel things in the force in turn have Jedi like reflexes, the evidence for this being in rogue one. This then led me to the differences between the dark and light sides of the force, we know each side has some kinds of abilities that and at least more difficult with the other side of the force and there are significant differences between the ways the users of both sides use there power. Dark side users are selfish and use the power to rule, in contrast light side users are “keepers of the peace not soldiers” one side is about dominating and the other side is about maintaining order, so only the light side being used is balance because the dark side is the opposite of balance, dominance. This is why Jedi believed exterminating the sith was balance, we also see proof in the powers each side has less difficulty doing, force lightning which is used to harm other exterminating others, and then how yoda absorbs force lightning protecting things/people, each side reflecting what each side is. The light side is balance in the force while the dark side is control."
459,1621024330.0,StarWarsTheories,"Just a random theory but thought it could be interesting - (spoilers for  Mando season two)

This is my first post so if it's done wrong let me know 😅


So I have a theory that could be interesting and it's that maybe Grogu turns to the dark side while he's training with Luke and the other students, Grogu would kill some students and destroy some things before being killed by luke, which is why when he senses Ben Solos dark side thoughts it made him feel like he had to stop it before it happened. 

But that's just some crazy idea I thought of 😁😁"
460,1620781556.0,StarWarsTheories,"Yoda's species is the embodiment of the light side of force - There was/is (I forget) a sith species that mostly all of them are force sensitive also they are red a embodiment of hate, and Yoda is green all of his species that we know of are green. They are all force sensitive mostly when a good and evil side are blue and green are normally good and red is bad. I know that sounds like something a five year old would say. But I'm not wrong.

I personally think that the characters in Star Wars do have free will.

I look at the nature of the prophecy and how our actions determine our future versus the conclusion that Anakin has no free agency because his future is already known. I do all of this while using a number of philosophers to help support the conclusion that the characters in Star Wars do in fact have free will. 

Do you think these characters have free will?

462,1620755145.0,StarWarsTheories,"Gregor's Return in The Bad Batch - So I had a fun idea that would bring back some beloved characters in the Bad Batch and help explain what happened to Gregor. Commandos typically are in squads of 4, right? So Gregor was seemingly the only survivor of Foxtrot group after the battle of Sarrish, which is how he ended up with amnesia on Abafar. So if he made it back to the Republic, he would probably be placed into a squad that needed to be filled. Who has an open slot in their squad after a mission on Kashyyyk? Delta Squad, because Sev is seemingly lost. Now this is only Legends background, but it could be made to fit into the new canon. They could regroup with their new member Gregor. The group would be tasked with hunting renegade clones. Who does that lead them to? Rex. They only find Rex after he has met back up with the Bad Batch and Delta Squad is subdued by them. While the other members of Delta Squad are uncooperative, Gregor listens to reason. Tech analyzes him and realizes his inhibitor chip is not as active as other clones from previous head trauma that caused his amnesia. This is how he is convinced to remove the inhibitor chip, but at the risk of some mental instability. I feel he would agree to this because he doesn't want to be under someone elses control like he was basically enslaved and controlled by Borkus on Abafar. The rest of Delta Squad however are left as they are still considered ""special regs"" by Wrecker. Later Delta Squad is retrieved by Crosshair who is tracking the Bad Batch. Not saying this is likely to happen, just a fun idea I thought I'd share."
463,1620710129.0,StarWarsTheories,"Sequel Luke is a decoy! - Ok so Luke in the sequels has a massive personality change and turns his back on the Jedi! Makes no sense but pretending that it does why would he go in to hiding on the famously missing home world of the first Jedi?

Obi-wan went in to hiding on tatooine and Yoda on Dagobah. I know neither turned their back on the Jedi but they went in to hiding and the reason it was successful was no one knew where they were! Luke on the other hand left bread crumbs and a galactic treasure hunt for Snoke and Kylo Ren to fixate on, why?

Well I think the answer is grogu. Or at least partly, see Luke knew something was up with Ben Solo, both of them say so when they have their sliding doors flashbacks. Hence Ben living in his own hut away from the temple when EVER other Jedi was in the temple. So Luke has precautions in place as Ben was showing dark tendencies BEFORE arriving at the temple.

So new Jedi order, where are the younglings? Where is grogu? Where are Luke’s family? Wow wow wow Luke’s family I hear you ask? Yeah Luke’s family in fact a wife and at least a daughter but I think two daughters. Not idle guess work this makes sense when seen from a Certain point of view.

This is 30 year after ROTJ and Luke is fixing the order so it doesn’t make the same mistakes again so connecting is allowed and I think Luke marries and has kids. So this is while Ben is groaning up with his parents growing darker. Luke has done his homework in his dad and see the same patterns so knows all the younglings are in danger so sends them away to be trains at. Secret academy back up under some Jedi possible Luke’s wife is a Jedi too.

So Ben turns up, sees all the Jedi are adults and never questions it, why would he? He hasn’t been to Jedi summer camp or anything! During training Luke ‘tests’ Ben to see the reaction of him stood over with lightsaber drawn. Luke is not expecting the wicked witch treatment and having a house fall on him. He comes too and all the adults are dead. So in order to keep the younglings safe Luke makes a big show of going in to hiding.

Alternatively, Master Luke Skywalker, hero of the rebellion decides to give up on Jedi teaching, the life he had dedicated himself to, the life he lost adopted parents, two masters, one hand and his own father to be a Jedi. To go in to hiding on a secret Jedi home world. All the while making sure everyone knows he is alive and letting way to many people know which planet he is going to be on and then hides the map with a friend and his droid. It seem a few too many loose ends if your giving up. Also if he meant to let the Jedi die why not just die?

The idea of the daughter is in the reaction to Rey, he lets her in easily when he is finished trying to gross her out. An odd approach when you want to be left alone but not so odd as a father teasing a child. I’m not claim Rey is his daughter just that she reminds him of them. How he talks to Rey is also more fatherly than as a master. Even the power he has encountered before and not respected enough has nothing to do with the force but the power of love for his children. As a twenty two year old he faced down the two most powerful Sith in a galaxy and survived why would he now be scared of powerful force wielders? More like the power of love for his family has torn him apart for years missing them. 

Where do they hide the younglings? Well where better than the home world of an old enemy of the Jedi? A world being rebuilt by a close relation to one of the younglings. A secretive society who keep outsiders at arms length. Mandalore!"

467,1620418832.0,StarWarsTheories,"Additional Evidence for Ashoka Timeline Split Theories - I assume anyone lurking this sub would know about this theory as it circulated a few months ago. I just learned of it recently and came across an extra piece of evidence. 

To bring anyone up to speed: The World between Worlds split the timeline into 2, one where Ahsoka is dead and one where she is alive. The theory supports that 7,8,9 take place in the dead timeline while Mandalorian and other shows are taking place in the alive timeline. A lot of this surrounds the point in time in which Luke takes Grogu to train. 

However, in the ahsoka is dead timeline: Bo Katan Nevers tells Mando to find Ahsoka, so Ahsoka never tells Mando to go to Tython, so Grogu never reaches out to Luke, and the whole party is defeated by the Dark Troopers because Luke doesn't come to save them. 

Now here's what I realized: In the dead timeline Mando never goes to Tython, so the Razorcrest never gets destroyed there. And Grogu is captured for clone testing on Exegol. If Mando survives the Dark Trooper assault he may attempt to rescue Grogu at some point. 
Well what ship do we see at the end of Ep9 coming to fight at Exegol with the civilian fleet? The Razorcrest. 

There is no possible way The Razorcrest could fight at Exegol if this is on the same timeline. The only excuses are that Mando had a new version of his antique pre-empire ship built exactly the same or that Disney is just so bad with Easter eggs that they are making impossible timelines. 

I know that none of this is complete proof, but it's just another piece of the puzzle that shows something weird is going on with Ahsoka being alive, and how that affects Mando and Grogu's story.

Edit: spelling"

So the force retaliated.

It created a species stronger in the force than anything before, something that could end the Sith empire, one that could bring peace to the galaxy once more. And thus, the species of Yoda was created. The force created something strong in both the light and dark side of the force. The force created a monster to kill a monster.

But these creatures were loyal to the force, they worshiped the force and let it flow through them. These creatures started an order dedicated to the force, where anyone could join.

469,1620400285.0,StarWarsTheories,"ROTS Theory - So rewatching the movies for May the 4th, I get to revenge of the sith, and I'm trying to reconcile the fight between Yoda and Sidious. Specifically, Yoda running after falling to the floor in the senate building when it feels like he still has a lot of fight left in him. Aside from the irony of this appearing to be the flip side of the very literal floor is lava fight between obi-wan and anakin, where Yoda must flee because he was the first to touch the floor and Sidious 'wins' because he could hang onto the floating seat thing (an interesting representation of the fight for balance between the light and dark sides of the force), I'm trying to find a reason why Yoda considers it a loss and doesn't continue to try to stop Sidous from taking over the republic.

 Near the end of the fight we see Yoda's cloak float down and land on some kind of object. This object looks a bit like the antenna that Luke falls onto after the fight with Vader in Cloud city. My speculation here is that in the moment this cloak catches the object, Yoda recognizes the future as it is presented to him by the force. Throughout everything in star wars we constantly hear how difficult it is to accurately predict the future and the meanings of the visions that force sensitive individuals have, but I think, in this moment, Yoda sees a metaphorical representation of the Jedi hanging on by a thread (pun mostly unintented). 

His era has failed to uphold what they stood for (falling due to arrogance and overconfidence in their abilities), but the light side of the force remains. Yoda sees the future of the force and knows that there is nothing more he can do to ensure that the light side will surivive, as his jedi cloak is being held up by something else. In this case I would think that Yoda flees from Sidious not because he can no longer fight, but because he recognizes that his way of doing things created the circumstances by which Sidious was able to gain power and by nature allows the dark side to thrive. Yoda let's go of his prominent role within the galaxy and within the living force so that the next generation can accomplish what he could not and maintain balance in the fight against the dark side."

I think that Omega has the ability to copy other people's skills/attributes. In these two episodes we know of a few things that she does abnormally well. 1) Sharpshooting, this is the most obvious one. In episode 1 we see Omega shoot the blaster out of Crosshair's hand. 2)Senses. In episode 1 we see Omega sense that Crosshair is about to come through the door when she says that they won't have to search long to find Crosshair. 3) Healing. We know that Omega is a good healer from Lama Sue in episode 1 but if Omega has enhanced aging, it is possible that she has only been alive for 5-7 years. I don't think that that is long enough to learn that especially because you can't do much when you are 1. 4) Catching the ball. This one is more debatable. In episode 2 we see Omega catch the ball on her second try and we also learned that she doesn't even know what the ball is. I don't think that it is likely that you catch a ball on the second time you ever try to catch any ball. 

Every single one of these we know that Omega saw someone else do that skill shortly before she does. And it also explains why she can't even try to fight the monster in episode 2."
472,1620389171.0,StarWarsTheories,"The inhibitor chips are a biological form of a Jedi mind trick. - This is more like two theories in one.  Jedi mind tricks only work on the “weak minded” who then is weak minded?  We see clones, stormtroopers, and others who are subservient to a strict hierarchy and do not have force powers.  I propose that a Jedi mind trick suppresses the part of the brain that is involved in decision making and puts at least part of the brain in a hypnotic trance and therefore vulnerable to suggestion.  It works particularly well on those who obey others because that obedience is hijacked and used against them.

The inhibitor chip in clones acts in a similar way but without the use of the force.  The clones are very much put into a partial hypnotic state and believe they are acting according to their free will when in fact they have almost no choice."

474,1620305653.0,StarWarsTheories,"My hopes for the future of the Bad Batch [SPOILERS] - Here are some of my hopes for the coming episodes based off what I've seen in the trailers and latest episode.

In the trailers it is clear that the Bad Batch find themselves in the criminal underworld. This leads me to believe that the Bad Batch will find themselves interacting with bounty hunters we hadn't seen for some time like Embo, Asajj Ventress, Boba Fett and Cad Bane. It would be nice to get some closure on some of their stories. I would also love to see the Batch run into Maul as he tries to put together his Crimson Dawn. We saw a Hologram of Dryden Vos in Season 7 so perhaps they will find more uses of his animation.

We will see much more of Saw Guerra. We only saw him briefly in Episode 1 but they have opened up so many possibilities for him in it. In Rogue One we are aware that the Rebel Alliance does not associate with Saw due to his extremist tactics, so it would be good to see Saw develop from a freedom fighter to a terrorist.

More Sepratists. Whatever way you look at it, the Sepratists did turn out to be correct about the Republic's Tyranny. While much of the droid army has been turned off, it would be great to see some pockets of Sepratists who wish to destroy the Empire, perhaps even General Kalani.

I am convinced there will be a Clone Rebellion by the Kaminoans. We saw that the Kaminoans helped the Bad Batch escape Kamino and the Prime Minister was in on it. Perhaps the Kaminoans wish to destroy the Empire to protect their profits and aid in restoring the Republic. A Clone Rebellion would be their best shot. To add to this. Rex is on the loose and is one of the only clones (Not including the Batch) without without inhibitor chip. He may be on a mission to help Clones and remove their chips just as Ahsoka removed his. These freed clones would then be aware of what happened and be more willing to fight for the Republic, we need to know how Wolfee and Gregor were saved. I would also love to see a Cody redemption story but I'm asking too much.

Perhaps the final episode would be a mishmash of The Bad Batch, New Clones, Old Clones who removed their Chips, Recommissioned Battle Droids, Saw Guerra's Partisans, Sepratist Fighters and maybe some Bounty Hunters. It is wishful thinking but fun to speculate."

The Kaminoan cloner helped the bad batch escape, and also clearly has problems with the newly appointed Empire. They have already had conflicts with this new government, and I believe this relationship will continue to go in this direction. 

That being said, it is entirely possible that the cloners start removing inhibitor chips of multiple clones to build some sort of independence from the Empire, just having people that might help give them leverage, and this will give Tarkin an excuse to wipe the cloning program off the map. 

I don't believe Boba will be included, but it might involve a bounty hunter or some other clone we already know. (Maybe Cody or someone like that, just to really hit in the feels)

Old clones remain in the Empire slowly getting replaced and outnumbered by recruitment from all over, making the Empire what it is later on.

2. Rex is on Selucamai with Cut Liquaine. Hunter told Tech to set a course for ""J-19"". In the Cut Liquaine Episodes in Season 2, Obi Wan translates Eith Coth's hand signals to ""Selucamai System, sector J-19, 08-05-29.""

482,1620095561.0,StarWarsTheories,"If Palpatine had won in Episode 9, things would be actually a lot worse than you'd imagine. - I feel like whenever people discuss TROS it usually devolves into a discussion about how silly the movie was, but let's just think about the implications seriously for a second, cause it's actually really interesting. This a really long post, so bear with me.

If Palpatine had won, the galaxy would have been doomed. And not in the ""subjugated under an oppressive regime"" type doomed, I mean like a potential galactic apocalypse type doomed, which is far worse.

So, Palpatine points superlasers at every important planet in the galaxy and demands their surrender, essentially holding everyone hostage, until his forces can swoop in, dismantle their government, and set up a First Order reign of terror. I assume, after any potential dissidents had been taken care of, he would have called the Xyston-class Star Destroyers off back to Exegol or some other stand-by location. Perhaps for some more troublesome planets, the Xystons would have hovered over the planet like the blade of Damocles, just in case anyone gets any funny ideas. I imagine that some planets that served the Rebellion back in the war would have been outright obliterated with no chance of surrender.

So, it's not impossible that the plan would work, there are very few ways to counter it, aside from maybe a kamikaze attack on a Xyston. Which would just make the situation worse, because now you've painted a target on your back, and the Final/First Order has literally THOUSANDS more. You've bought yourself and your planet a couple hours, at most. So I see no way how the Resistance can come out on top.

But over the next couple of years, or months, I imagine things would start to break down.

1. **One does not simply invade the galaxy**For one thing, even if the First Order and Final Order combined, they wouldn't have the power to *occupy* the galaxy. The only reason why the Empire managed stay somewhat stable was because they inherited their assets from the Republic, which had been slowly built up over TENS OF THOUSANDS of years. There are Old Republic treaties and laws which are older than entire civilizations, the roots go far too deep. If the Republic disappeared, the galaxy would fall into complete and utter chaos. And no, the Republic never technically disappeared, it was transformed the Empire, which was structurally the same, just managed differently. And the Rebellion was just parts of the Empire that didn't like the way things were run, and there was a big civil war between the people who missed the good old days, and the people who wanted things to stay the way they were now. But all of the pieces had been there from the beginning.The First Order, on the other hand, is an invading force. They literally came from the Unknown Regions, geographically disconnected from the rest of the galaxy. True, they're built off of the Imperial Remnant, but aside from all of the intel they inherited from the Empire, they hold no stake in mainstream galactic affairs. They could have stayed in the Unknown Regions for the next hundred years and manage perfectly fine. Almost no one knew they existed until they fired Starkiller Base. And this goes doubly so for the Final Order, who are so secretive that even the *First Order* didn't know they existed! There's no way they could waltz in and conquer the galaxy, which is why they had to build superweapons to scare everyone. Their forces would be spread thin, one Star Destroyer for like, 500 star systems. And yeah, the Republic/Empire didn't have enough ships to patrol EVERY planet either, because you know why? They already had a system of government in place! You don't need to have a constant military presence if you already have a functioning government. And I know, the Empire had an overly strong military presence, but it was because 1. Palpatine was a lunatic and 2. The Empire still governed the galaxy, the Star Destroyers were just overkill. In fact, this overkill were what led to the Rebellion being formed in the first place. But if the First Order takes their eyes off of a planet for a second, everything goes to hell, which brings me to my next point.
2. **The Galactic Apocalypse**Who in their right mind would want THOUSANDS of mini Death Stars flying around?? That's crazy even by Palpatinian standards! Way too many loose ends. That'd be like, if on Earth, we just had millions of nukes lying around... OH WAIT.Jokes aside, this sounds like a literal nightmare. True, all of the Final Order officers serve Palpatine, but it's not like he has 100% control of them, so it's not impossible for one ship to go rogue. And all it takes is one wrong planet to be blown up for the entire galaxy to go to hell. Let's say, a Final Order and aFirst Order captain have a dispute. A Final Order Star Destroyer threatens a planet that is already loyal to the First Order, just to send a message. (This sounds crazy, but Star Wars villains really think this way, look at what Tarkin did to Alderaan.) The First Order doesn't like this very much. Who the hell do these (other) brainwashed weirdoes think they are? The First Order tries to question the Final Order, but due to their separation for 30 yeas, the ideological differences are too much. Best case scenario, the Final Order, which most likely outranks the First Order, executes some officers for ""treason"" and installs a loyal officer in his/her place Worst case scenario, one of the Final Order officers fires on the planet and destroys it, to send a ""message."" (Remember, Tarkin.) News of this trickles throughout the galaxy, and now tensions between the two factions are at an all time high. Things could escalate into a faction war, with both sides blowing up planets willy nilly. Maybe even the Resistance/Republic gets involved, and they decide to start blowing up planets in self defense. The ""good guys"" doing this sounds horrible, but everyone has morals until the superlaser starts powering up.
3. **The Aftermath**When the dust settles, there may be hundreds, maybe even thousands of planets destroyed, thus sending the galaxy into a dark age which will take millennia to recover from. Entire civilizations lost, trillions of beings dead. I imagine that every Force user in the galaxy, trained or not, would go mad, as the Force would literally be screaming in despair. The Force wouldbe so twisted that it would alter the fabric of space itself, making hyperspace travel borderline impossible. Now what planets are left are isolated, and licking their wounds, struggling to stay alive. Hyperspace routes become a rare commodity, with gangs fighting over the lanes. People wish for the old days, when there was a Republic, or even an Empire, whatever, it was better than what they have now. At this point, Star Wars switches genres from a fun scifi/action/fantasy story to a gritty scifi/action/apocalyptic story, and throw in some dystopian, or even some cosmic horror elements as well, given how screwed up the Force would be. That would make for an absolutely DOPE story. Imagine a lone Jedi knight, having to navigate the Force blindly, having to rebuild the galaxy from scratch. Someone write that fanfic and get back to me."

484,1619825557.0,StarWarsTheories,"One of my Theories about Darth Vader's Force power (and its diminishment) its not finished but yeah. - As we all know, Darth Vader was meant to become more powerful than any other sith ever, but he lost his limbs because of his battle on Mustafar with Obi-Wan. Now it has been seen that the loss of his organic limbs is what set him to lesser force powers than Palpatine only reaching 80% of Palpatine's force power, but what I think is that although the loss of his limbs played a role, it was not as prominent as you might think. I think that Vader's loss in power was more psychological. He lost everyone and always had Anakin in him, the idea of an Angel on one shoulder and a Deamon on the other relates to Vader on one shoulder and Anakin on the other. In the movies, Luke says ""The Emperor hasn't fully driven the Good out of you yet"" now what I'm thinking is that if Palpatine fully drew out the good from Vader and he became a true sith and submitted himself fully to the Dark Side, he could have reached 90-99% of **his** potential, obviously the loss of organic limbs playing a role. Once Anakin is removed from Vader he won't care for Padme or Luke or anything that hindered Anakin, he will become a full **Sith Lord**. This would make him almost twice as powerful as Palpatine, therefore making him more powerful than any other living being in the galaxy, with this power he could succeed Palpatine as Emperor (in the true sith way) and rule over the Galaxy. With all this power Vader could unlock secrets to the Dark Side of the force discovering new powerful force powers and becoming unstoppable. On another note, as we can see from legends Vader held the power to 'level 3' force lightning, while Palpatine only held access to 'level 2' force lightning, we see the Son use level 3 force lightning in the Clone Wars. Once he has this power Vader might even be able to use force lightning without killing himself using the force."
485,1619551869.0,StarWarsTheories,"Rebel Bail-Out...? Could he have built a better Rebellion or was he a hero for keeping the Jedi secret? Even from each other? - It occurred to me, recently, that I had not given much thought to the role of Sen. Bail Organa in building the bourgeoning Rebellion.  Sure, I was aware, of course, that he was raising a Princess who was the genetic offspring of one of the most powerful Jedi-turned-Sith in the Galaxy and that he continued to serve the Galactic Senate, while clandestinely undermining it along with Mon Mothma and others.  However, as RotS draws to a close, Organa is present as Yoda and Obi-wan decide how best to hide the Skywalker children.  He actually hears Obi-wan ask ""What of the boy?"" and Yoda's reply ""To Tatooine; to his family send him,"" as well as Kenobi's promise to watch over Luke there. 

Why does this matter?  Sometime over the intervening 15+ years (as depicted in the Ahsoka novel, I believe, though I did not re-read it before posting), Bail find's Ahsoka, warns her about the Inquisitors, and enlists her into the intelligence wing of the Rebellion, codename: ""Fulcrum.""  Shortly thereafter, he encounters Kanan Jarrus with Ezra Bridger (and the Ghost Crew.) 

At this point in time, one man - Bail Organa - knows that a) Jedi Grand-master Yoda survived Order 66 and, while in hiding, may still be in contact with b) Obi-wan Kenobi, who is most likely on Tatooine and was, at one time, very closely acquainted with c) a very well-trained, former Jedi Padawan in the form of Ahsoka Tano, as she is in his employ and d) is running missions with another former, trained Padawan, Kanan Jarrus, and his force-sensitive protégé, Ezra Bridger.

Could Bail have orchestrated an emergency Jedi staff-meeting at some point?  Maybe a Zoom call, at least?  Did he make an attempt?  Was that rebuffed by Obi-wan?  By Yoda?  Or did the over-arching fear of the Inquisitors and/or Vader force him to hold his tongue, only daring to introduce Jarrus/Bridger and Tano, with no mention of Yoda or Kenobi?  What would have happened if these Jedi had reformed, to any degree, and more directly helped each other in aiding the Rebellion?  Would the risk to Luke and Leia or even Yoda and Obi-wan, themselves, have been too great?  Does this mean that Tano, Jarrus and Bridger were, in Organa's opinion, more expendable or served a less grand purpose than Yoda and Kenobi?

I am not sure where I land on this, ultimately, which is part of the reason I post - to seek insights from the group - but, I think its possible, and most likely, that Organa did inform Yoda/Kenobi that there were other ""Jedi"" aiding the Rebellion.  Yoda makes a conscious effort to commune with Jarrus/Bridger through the Jedi Temple on Lothal and Kenobi seemed to know who Bridger was and the nature of his mission at their meeting on Tatooine, not to mention that Maul was still alive and still seeking his vengeance.  (Now, we could explain this entire paragraph on a Jedi's ability to sense and read the Force, but throughout Cannon it would seem the force only passively gives off generic signals, alarms, proximity indicators, warm fuzzies, etc., and doesn't constantly keep the Jedi up-to-date like a stock ticker or CNN news scroll (or Reddit feed, if you like.)  Rather, it can work a little more like a search engine, assuming that you ""reach out"" with very precise Boolean terms and don't mind your search history and IP address being communicated to the rest of the Galaxy, especially the Empire.)

So, does it make sense that Bail would have informed the Jedi Masters of the efforts of those aiding the Rebellion?  Does it further make sense that neither Kenobi or Yoda would take much action upon hearing that info?  Could Bail have done more?  Should he have done more? 

What portion of the above will likely be address or resolved in the upcoming Kenobi series? 

(Note:  Please try to refrain from citing continuity issues with the OT, i.e. Obi-wan doesn't know R2 or, even Leia, Own Lars hates the crazy, old ""wizard"" who is ""protecting"" his nephew, Yoda's ""another"" could be Grogu or Ahsoka and not ""sister"", etc. At some point we have to be respectful of the fact that GL was not planning to make the prequels when he made the OT and was not even sure the second installment would be greenlighted, so some leeway is deserved if there are continuity mismatches here and there.)"

488,1618871725.0,StarWarsTheories,"Vader/Sidious Symbiosis - Here is my thoughts. I believe that Darth Sidious planned more of Vader's conversion to the dark side than many perceive, even down to his wounds from the battle with Obi-Wan. The reason was in order to gain control over Anakin. I believe that Darth Sidious was maintaining Vader through the force through a form of symbiosis.

The reason being that in the closing scene of Revenge of the Sith, when Anakin was left for dead by Obi-Wan, Darth Sidious was able to save his life through the force using a Symbiotic bond. As long as Sidious remains alive and willing, he is able to maintain Vaders life. This resulted in Vader being unable to go against Sidious, and as well as being unable to revert back to Jedi beliefs. 

Another reason for this theory, is the tale of Darth Plagueis. Since Sidious was Plagueis' apprentice, he would have known someone as powerful as Anakin could have been a threat to him. By keeping him alive only through symbiosis, he would be safe from Vader because if he dies, Vader does too.

Ultimately, this makes the end of Return of the Jedi make sense as well. Since Vader finally acted against Sidious, Sidious ended the symbiotic bond. Thus finally ending Vaders life. This also works with the fact that Anakin ghost arrives with the Jedi, because he was never truly a Sith, only manipulated by Sidious. He acted as directed by Sidious only through self preservation. 

Also, maintaining Vader's life would have dramatically reduced Sidious' abilities throughout the period of the Empire, as it would have taken a lot of his mental and physical endurance to maintain. Basically, he was much more free after Vader's death to manipulate the rest of the sequel trilogy behind the scenes from Exegol."
489,1618693274.0,StarWarsTheories,"Palpatine had planned on the CIS invading courasaunt later. - I believe the palpatine feared the relationship between ashoka and anakin, which is why he manipulated her out of the order.  I also think palpatine knew rex would be hesitant to kill any jedi master. 

So here goes the theory.
Upon learning that anakin, obi wan and ashoka were together again and heading to mandalore. Palpatine realised that he must separate the trio or bring them away from mandalore as they would've  learned the truth from maul and together with Rex they would've escaped. The only thing that could possibly pull them away from maul and mandalore was the invasion.

The rejoining of ashoka was unseen by palpatine. But once he knew he triggered the CIS invasion knowing that all three would come to courasaunt. Palpatine didn't expect the promotion of rex. The promotion of rex to commander is the only reason Asokha survives.

Palpatine hoped he could take the opportunity to take out asokha and rex on grevious' ship."

&#x200B;

I think that we are going to see Director Krennic potentially around season 2 or later into season 1.

And with his introduction I think the bad batch may be looking into the construction of the death star.

I think this would be great because it would give us more insight to Krennic and Tarkins rivalry along 

with the potential of seeing a Prototype Death Star Laser that wont be as powerful...lets say like half of the death stars single reactor charge. 

and this weapon will be utilized to destroy separatist strongholds."
494,1617821667.0,StarWarsTheories,"Kyber Crystals and Antimatter - I have a theory about the nature of energy production of kyber crystals. Essentially they are antimatter generators controlled by electricity. Hear me out.

When antimatter and matter collide, it results in an antimatter elimination. 1kg anti to 1kg matter elemination is roughly equivalent to the energy output of the Tsar Bomba, the strongest nuclear weapon detonated on this planet at 41 megatons of TNT. So extreme levels of energy are produced via elimination. But this occurs with objects with mass (protons and neutrons, but not electrons and photons.)

Next, when jedi use the force, the main aspects of reality they manipulate is gravity/gravity waves (force pull, taking long falls and high jumps, ect) and manipulation of electrical fields (force lightning, and manipulating the electrical impulses in out brains in a jedi mind trick. We see often in force interrogations the body goes tense, indicating the excessive stimulation of our nervous systen).

As kyber crystals are attuned with the force, jedi can use their manipulation of electrical fields to better interface with a crystal, but a simple electrical current can activate them (Finn, Grievous and the Death Star)

So a lightsaber might create eliminations of the atomic level, seriously atom by atom, generating and extreme amount of plasma but not exploding. Whereas the death star functions differently. It uses a high powered laser to create a channel with no mass, ie only electrons and photons, for anitmatter to travel through. The laser clears the path to the target, and then burrows into the planet, possible using a gram at a time of antimatter to dig. Then a massive amount of antimatter is introduced to the depths of the planet, probably in the millions of tons, destroying it in the resulting elimination

Plot holes: if kyber crystals have mass how are they not eliminated? Is plasma truly without mass?

496,1617578014.0,StarWarsTheories,"Lightsaber Colors in Sequels... - Now I haven't read any of the books, but I have watched all the movies multiple times, and I would consider myself a big fan of Star Wars. but there is an issue I have with the choice of color of lightsabers in the new movies (Ep. VII-IX). (Excuse inperfect English)

First, Ben Solo. I write Ben since this refers to the time he spent training with Luke at the new Temple. In the flashback to when Luke tried to kill Ben, we can see the color of Ben's saber is blue. I think it should have been green. From what I've gathered, jedi with green sabers are strong with the force, while not beeing particularly skilled with the lightsaber in combat. We've seen Ben, as Kylo, use the force to completely incapacitate Rey, get information from people and stop blaster shots mid-air. This, doesn't seem like something someone without a STRONG connection and skill with the force should be able to do. We've also seen that Kylo Ren lacks a bit in the lightsaber combat department. So in conclusiuon, I think Ben's lightsaber should have been green in that flashback. 

Secondly, Rey. In the last scene of The Rise of Skywalker, she shows us her lightsaber, her own lightsaber. And I always thought it was Orange, but as it turns out, no, it's yellow aparently. I didn't think this made very much sence. Orange would have been SUCH a good fit for her, she is a palpatine, while she is also a Jedi, wouldn't that make her a perfect candidate for beeing a ""grey Jedi"" that carry orange lightsabers. As they are a mix of both the light and the dark, but are still Jedi. This would make sence, noy only because of her heritage, but also, we've seen her use anger to best opponents, which sounds like a really dark side move. This is the reasons Rey's lightsaber should have been orange, and doublesided, since she is used to fighting with staffs and because I think Darth Maul is really quite neat. 

Does anyone have a explanation for this not beeing the case, lorewise and filmproduction wise? And is there anyone who agrees with me?"

504,1616840709.0,StarWarsTheories,"Marchion Ro could be the same species as the Sixth Brother with possible ties with the unknown regions and the Chiss and how the Ro family came to lead the Nihil. - **Small spoilers for Light of the Jedi**

Neither Marchion Ro or the Sixth Brother's species have been identified; I propose a theory that they are both a species originating on the edge of the unknown regions and the Outer Rim. The Sixth Brother was previously a Jedi which means he was sought out by a Jedi who could have been lead to the edge of Known Space by the force to induct the child into the order (alternatively the Sixth Brother's parents could have migrated from the unknown regions to the Outer Rim). In the novel 'Ahsoka' neither Ahsoka or Kaeden could identify his species but he was described as near human with grey skin and uniform scar-like markings on his face. Marchion Ro's species has also not yet be disclosed; considering his knowledge of the hyperspace paths and how they can be discovered through a connection with the force (Mari San Tekka), this might suggest he gained his knowledge from the Chiss and their 'skywalkers' who fulfil a very similar role. 

Marchion's family could have learned the secrets from the Chiss (or elsewhere in the unknown regions); after the Ro family left their homeworld (possibly due to a conflict with the Chiss) they could have come into conflict with the Jedi when trying to abduct a force sensitive child to use in order to discover paths to obtain a sense of power within the known galaxy; Asgar Ro could have later found a dying Mari San Tekka, abducting her and keeping her alive by any means necessary whilst obtaining the paths (Asgar would already know the technology needed to create the path engines, possibly because the Ro family worked for the Chiss to create their ships). With the ability to obtain hyperspace paths, Asgar Ro and his young son Marchion would then approach the Outer Rim marauders know as the 'Nihil' and promise them a way to obtain power in exchange for the position of 'The Eye'.

Outlandish and somewhat complex theory which will likely be proven false in the coming months, but I think it has some merit and possibility."

Qui-Gonn followed the will of the Force, so would it be plausible to infer that in order to become a force ghost? You had to follow the will of the force?    
Since we found out from Palpatine in ep. 9 that “all the sith” continue growing as a sith apprentice strikes down his master, I feel like the Jedi becoming force ghosts is what brings “balance” to the light/dark relationship of the force.

508,1616373905.0,StarWarsTheories,"Yet another Mortis theory! Mine this time - This is based only on what we see of Mortis in canon- no legends material taken into consideration. I believe this is part of what the original intention was. I don’t think there needs to be a ‘Mother’ character (I think if there were, we would have seen her painted in the Rebels mural). I think the Daughter is a goddess of mostly light, the Son is a god of mostly dark and there is a sole parental figure (who once was mortal) to balance the two. I say the Father once was mortal because he wants Anakin, the Chosen One, to replace him; of course Anakin is mortal so I think by taking the role of balancer on Mortis you become immortal. Likely the Father was the previous Chosen One, an ancient Jedi (Anakin is brought to Mortis by a 2,000-year old Jedi distress code after all). Who knows how far back in time there have been Chosen Ones called to Mortis, but my hypothesis is that if they are female they become the Mother, and if male they become the Father (which is fitting for Anakin anyway). Lastly, the father was the only one of the Mortis gods who disappeared like Obi-Wan when he died, hence another reason why I think the parental figure on Mortis is of a different nature. The Father also never shapeshifts like his ‘children’ iirc. 

Earlier I mentioned that I did think the  Son and Daughter were truly deities. I also said they are not fully each dark or light because in that Clone Wars arc the Son is said to fall to the dark side. I think they each are just heavily biased one way or the other. When Anakin subdues them we also see a Yin/Yang kind of pattern in the arena setting. So I think we can interpret that meaning that neither or the Son or Daughter was fully dark or light to begin with. Anyway those are my thoughts. Even if true there still remains a lot of mystery to Mortis!"

And after he tried to kill Palpatine and sort of forced Anakin into betraying in order to save Padmé, he realized that he was too dark and the path he had gone down after killing jango was a path of darkness. So he goes along a path of self redemption that ends with him giving himself up to Boba to decide his fate, riddled with the guilt that his actions brought the fall of the republic that began with him wronging Boba he decapitating his father in one of the most grand displays of arrogance in Jedi history in the first battle of Geonosis.

510,1616176247.0,StarWarsTheories,"Force Nexuses and ""Balance"" - Good Morning! I've been thinking a lot recently about Jedi Temples and then came across a post that mentioned Force Nexuses. It sparked a few thought connections I had and I wanted to get some thoughts! Bear in mind that I don't have much in the way of links to share as far as sources, but I will be trying to stick within the bounds of Canon, and am open to being corrected!

&#x200B;

To begin, my personal visualization of the Force is something akin to [Indra's Net](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indra%27s_net), briefly described as a sort of energy web that weaves across all space, and at it's connections is our consciousness (Massive over simplification). As it relates to the Force, those connections would represent a Force Nexus. We know there is a Living and Cosmic Force, and while they are different they are also the same, so I will stick to simply referring to it as the Force.

Now, we know Force Nexuses to be simply: any location that is unusually strong in the Force. I think this intentionally very general description allows for some creative interpretation of the two words Location and Unusual. This may feel nitpicky but it's important to my thought process. 

One could argue that Location means a specific unmoving spot, but I don't think that fits. We know that the Force is an energy field created by all life, so it stands to reason that Location isn't necessarily physical space, but rather the Life in the space. I think this further enforced by the concept of midichlorians, and high concentrations of them.

If we use that as an operating definition for the word Location, we then need to examine Unusual. If Life is the Location, then one could say that all Force Users could potentially be Force Nexuses. I don't agree with that interpretation, because if the Force is in all life the simple ability to ""Manipulate"" it doesn't appear unusual. Multiple non-human/humanoid creatures have been shown to be Force Sensitive, with varying levels of sentience (i.e. [Loth-wolves](https://starwars.fandom.com/wiki/Loth-wolf), [The Bendu](https://starwars.fandom.com/wiki/Bendu)). I would say that Unusual is to mean something a little more extreme than out-of-the-ordinary.

With those two words loosely identified, I can dig into the theorizing!

I believe every single life-hosting planet/moon has a Force Nexus. The Nexus is what allows for life to exist in the space, most likely where these midichlorians ""reproduce"" or whatever they do before going out and symbiotically linking with the life that's begun to grow. As life continued to develop it grew more and more complex, resulting in life that was Force Sensitive. As the more sentient species began to travel and colonize, so did those species Force Sensitives. Now the founding of the Jedi is still shrouded by history, but we the audience know that the Birthplace of the Jedi is the Planet Anch-To. 

I believe one particularly adventurous force user followed their gut through space and discovered Anch-To. When they arrived they explored the largest island they came across, discovering first the Mirror Cave underneath the island, and then the Giant Tree at the top. On this very small island surrounded by sea water they saw a limited yet thriving pocket of terrestrial life. This Island was, at the time, Anch-To's Force Nexus. This adventurer who would become the first Jedi, likely decided of their own volition that they preferred meditation in the tree, to in the cave and slowly but surely ""Purified"" the nexus, creating the very first Jedi Temple, inside the tree. By imposing their own will on the space, The Jedi solidified the location of that Planet's nexus.

Once the first Jedi got back to people, they conveyed their new found ""understanding"" of Force Nexuses, and declared the creation of an Order of Force users that would share his vision of ""Purifying""  all worlds Nexuses. Thus birthing the Jedi Oder.

Now, on to the Jedi Temples.

&#x200B;

The Jedi began by making their temples out of the natural landscape that made up each planets Nexus. The Giant Tree on Anch-To, Large standing rocks on Lothal, and i'm sure many others. This was the initial will of the Force, and these ""purifications"" would bring stability to the development of life, and create peaceful worlds. However as time went on, the Jedi began to build separate structures into these Nexuses, like the Jedi Temple on Coruscant that was built overtop a mountain. These monuments to the Jedi were the beginning of the perversion of the Prime Jedi's will, and thus the beginning of the universes imbalance.

With all these Force Nexuses that had been ""Purified"" and then subsequently perverted, the force had to strike it's own balance by allowing ""the dark side"" to become dominant in some of it's nexuses (the dark side is in quotes because the dark side is specifically stated as a perversion of the Force by living things imposing their will on the Force). We can see, like from the Nexus on Dagobah, that when ""the dark side"" is dominant in a nexus that planet can grow wild and unruly. 

&#x200B;

Now to the ""Balance""

It is my opinion that Anakin Skywalker was a unique Sentient Force Nexus. Qui-Gon was right to believe that Anakin was the Chosen One from their Jedi Prophecy, but not for the reason we think. The Jedi tried to do with him what they do with every other Nexus they found, and turn him into a Monument to the success of the Jedi. Anyone who fights with him becomes more powerful, though he himself is more stunted in power. Once he has become corrupted, he saps power from his enemies, and reaches a height previously unobtainable to him. His individual life was a balance of light and dark, which the Force intends for all, his were just at the extreme. 

However, it is my opinion that ""Balance"" in the Force has nothing to do with actual Force Users. The Force is in balance when The Nexus of each planet is left unbothered. The original purification and tethering of the Nexus were a way to bring order and peace to a planet, but the continued Force Disturbances caused by Jedi and Sith occupying these Nexuses is what throws everything out of balance. And I believe this ripple of unbalance began when The Ones arrived on Mortis.

We know that Mortis is the strongest Force Nexus in the Universe, and we know The Ones are insanely powerful force wielders. I believe that they settled on Mortis as a result of their Ego, thinking that they must be the ones tasked with balancing the Force at the Force's inception point. Their presence on Mortis was a corruption and an irritation to the Force, and so it created a balance. Since this place of the Force was at the mercy of Force users, the Force created a Force user that was at the mercy of the Force. Anakin came to Mortis and cast out The Ones. This began the new ripple of balance, that would ultimately cull the galaxies sentient force users, so each planet's nexus would have time free from any force wielder's influence to regain their natural balance. 

&#x200B;

As time goes on, perhaps a new fledgling order will be able to recall the Prime Jedi's original vision, and set out to once again bring peace to wild planets, while hopefully remembering it's previous lessons.

After seeing vizla use the darksaber, the weapon of a Jedi from long ago, she split off making her own group even closer to the “true” ways of Mandalor, the children of the watch, modeling her armor off the golden helmet of mand’alor and even her practices, forsaking your name and face. She still stayed in good graces with Bo but did not join or fight along death watch, this is why she was still given foundlings.

I don't think this was his plan. If he was trying to manipulate the republic and separatists for his own gain, he wouldn't want anyone to know about that especially while he was using Anakin and changing him to the dark side.

Palpatine was smart enough to put in a plan B that the Jedi wouldn't expect if they were starting to win the war and somehow found out about his plans. He knew he couldn't keep everything secret forever so that must have been one of his other options.

Also, the letter B in ASCII code for binary and such is 66. It could just be a coincidence but I think this was done on purpose to show it as a plan B for the end of the war.

Edit: forgot to specify that the Plan A was what Palpatine was doing before he got caught as the bad guy. He was manipulating Anakin to become Vader and also playing on both sides of the war. When he got confronted, he killed Mace and started Plan B soon after (order 66).

Edit 2: I’m sure my theory is flawed since Palpatine wanted power not a war for years and years but he probably had tons of plans in case something went wrong. He was a master at manipulation so he would’ve won no matter what he did. Nice to see lots of comments debating this theory. Thanks for chipping in. Keep commenting if you want cause I’d like I see where this goes."

However - when the droid is fatally wounded it is presented with a choice to:

A) Die a martyr for what it believes in - as a free droid

B) Live on but become a slave computer to the Falcon's nav system and in turn become the very thing it was fighting against; a slave tool for humans

It chose B because it lacked conviction and chose to save itself instead, ironically becoming a slave to Han/Chewy who I assumed erased/discarded it while performing various modifications on the Falcon (likely after extracting the nav data they needed), due to the fact that they never mention it ever again.

Even Lando never brings up the utility droid ever again."

A duel happened earlier that directly mirrored this, but it isn’t discussed as much, Mace vs the Emperor. It is said that Qui Gon’s death sealed Anakin’s fate, but I don’t think that was the last hope. He hadn’t turned to the dark side when he returned to the Emperor during the fight. When Mace had “defeated” the Emperor, it was the exact same scenario as when Luke defeated Vader, if Mace hadn’t tried to kill him in anger, that would have affected Anakin in the same manner, he would have gone to help arrest the Emperor, and when the Emperor revealed he wasn’t defeated, Mace and Anakin would have fought him together.

520,1614952977.0,StarWarsTheories,"The righteous owner of the dark saber. - Who is the righteous owner of the dark saber?

OK. let's calculate.

First, the dark saber belonged to Tarre Vizla, the Mandalorian who created it. after his death, the saber was kept in the Jedi temple, until some Mandalorians broke in and took it. over the centuries, it killed many Jedi. Finally, Pre Vizla lost the dark saber to Maul (formerly Darth, now only Maul.)

Ok, now it gets both confusing and interesting at the same time. Palpatine, still as chancellor, defeat Maul and captured him. I know maul broke out later, but that isn't the point. the point is that if the dark saber belongs to anybody who *defeats* the owner, then it belonged to Palpatine. now, continuing on, we see that Vader throws Palpatine down to who knows where, but he *does* survive in the form of clones, so it belongs to the Palpatine who meets Rey, Rey basically kills Palpatine, thus the saber belongs to ray.

now, going back to the part where I said 'interesting'. if the dark saber belongs to someone who defeats the owner, detains or kills them, and keeps them detained or dead, then the saber belongs to obi wan Kenobi, who is killed by Vader, who is basically killed by palps force lightning, who is killed by Vader but is not killed by Vader, and the rest is the same.

It would be interesting to see if Vader and Maul are similar in power right after ROTS while Vader is getting accustomed to his armor, injuries and the dark side and then as he gets more powerful his strength surpasses Mauls throughout the story,

We have 14 years between rebels and ROTS, and that’s a lot of time for Maul to make some Mischief and he seemed to be known by the inquisitors. 

I think also Maul may take on a couple of apprentices to assist him in fighting Vader. I wouldn’t be surprised to see some of Ventress’s story play out also and be interwoven with Mauls

523,1614860458.0,StarWarsTheories,"In ROTJ, Luke asked Leia about their mother as a test of her Force sensitivity. - The Skywalker twins were too young and met their mother so briefly that there is no way they could have any actual memory of their mother. Luke likely knows this, and/or it’s reasonably plausible that he could/would have learned the specific circumstances of his birth via force meditation or a commune with Force ghost Obi-Wan. 

With this understanding, and contemplating a way to explain to Leia that she’s his sister, he decided to perform a “test” as to his sister’s Force sensitivity. “Do you remember your mother?” The only way Leia could access a visible image of her mother would be through the Force. Upon hearing her response “images, feelings really”, Luke stares into the distance, contemplates her answer, and then utters “I have no memory of my mother.” At that moment, he realizes that Leia is not only Force sensitive, (which suggests a linkage to the Skywalker Force sensitive bloodline), but also that she may be EVEN MORE force sensitive than he is (since even he cannot recall what Padme looked like).

Leia’s Force Sensitivity is heavily downplayed in the sequels, and her character is largely not expanded upon or developed. However, with the recently announced “galactic expansion” (as I’m calling it) with Filoni/Favreau at the helm, and with Luke appearing in top form (and largely redeeming his besmirched character), there may be great opportunity to also redeem Leia during that same time period. A cameo with her as a near fully trained Jedi, with raw potential, rivaling or evening surpassing Luke, even with our knowing her Jedi career may be short-lived and ill-fated, would be cathartic. As we’ve now seen with Luke, even one brief scene/sequence can completely alter the perception of a character forever."
524,1614840388.0,StarWarsTheories,"Grogu is a clone of Yoda with accelerated aging like all the Clonetroopers, and with false memories. And is the only successful clone of a Jedi/Sith to retain Force powers. (That's why we saw no flashbacks despite what Ahsoka saying he was a Order 66 survivor). - *Sorry for the grammar above.

Grogu can not be a baby forever. So the accelerated aging would solve the problem (He would be biologically 50 years old but who knows when he was created, he would be created from the robes that Yoda left in the Senate after being defeated by Darth Sidious, so he would have to be created after Order 66). Darth Sidious would see the potential of raising and training someone with a the midhiclorian count of Yoda since childhood. So it would make sense. 

If he has accelerated aging. Grogu can age at whatever rythim they want him to, and we could get to Yoda age at some point. That would tie into the lab story-line. And would also make him a mirror to Boba Fett journey in a sense, since they would both be clones ""made in Kamino"". And to Ahsoka and to Luke Skywalker, since both knew Yoda pretty well.

It would also explain why the Empire remnants of Moff Giddeon want his blood. Is because is the only successful clone of a Jedi to also have the Force. They want to figure him out to be able to clone Palpatine (and posibly Anakin or Luke).

Is unexpected and yet still possible. While Ahsoka Tano said that Grogu was a survivor of Order 66, since we saw no flashbacks, it would still be possible for them to say he had false memories implanted by the cloners from Kamino for whatever reason. Also, being revealed a clone, given how Jedi killed clones would give him some interesting conflict with being a Jedi. (Note: As some have commented, there may be some Yoda´s blurry Clone Wars memories in there too, explaining why Grogu is so powerful in the Force despite being a kid. Also while Boba Fett has no memories of Jango Fett, he does retain the skills, and memories may be retained when the clones have the Force).

And the accelerated aging would help make him different from Yoda, which would be good too. I would suggest that despite being biologically 50 years, he was created at least 6 years before the Mandalorian. So he aged 50 years in 6 years, if the Mandalorian has a 6 years time-skip, Grogu would be 100. The same age Yoda had as at least a padawan, and he would be light-saber battle ready. And since Yoda lived 900 years, that would mean at 12 years then Grogu would only be 100, battle ready with a light-saber (and at 120 years he would hit 900 years), take it or leave it on how quickly he ages. 

But it nicely adds up to something very close the life-span of a normal human, which would be perfect for story-telling. (He doesn't even need to talk that much at 100, just be old enough to hold a light-saber, the fast aging would also be way to keep the character fresh for as long as he get to survive).

And I do get not wanting all characters to be related to each other, and Grogu to be a no one. But this is about wanting Grogu to talk and defend himself, while his Mandalorian father still lives. That's why I want him to age faster, I think it would be cool if Grogu had visions of his Mando father Din dying like the ones Anakin had of his mother in Episode II: Attack of the Clones. So he leaves the Jedi Temple to save Din. That's how they meet again. It was better for Rey to be a no one, but for Grogu I rather be able to see him hold a light-saber while fighting along his father Mando.

Note: Plus the clone storyline could open the doors for clones of other cool legacy characters, it would be interesting to see Luke and Ahsoka Tano dueling against a clone of Anakin Skywalker. Imagine seeing the Darth Vader of the Rogue One hallway massacre scene (as a cloned Anakin) against the Luke of The Mandalorian, it would work. I imagine the Anakin clone would get quickly killed with the lab destroyed but Luke doing what he could not in Return of the Jedi (but without actually doing it), it would definitely take a tool on Luke and make sense with his Last Jedi character. Also I don´t like Episode IX at all, nor the poorly unexplained and not in the film Palpatine cloned explanations, but I think Grogu being a Yoda clone could work and somewhat fix the storyline pretty well while connecting most of the characters in an interesting way.

Note#2: Also in regards to Grogu after the sequel trilogy, my opinion of Rise of Skywalker is that Darth Sidious/ Palpatine told Rey, that he had the Sith power to  possess /take over / transfer his spirit into Rey´s body, if Rey killed him. I perceive Rey killed Darth Sidious, and that Darth Sidious plan went accordingly and Darth Sidious won like in Revenge of the Sith. The training and trials to become a Force Ghost are discovered by Qui-Jon and not shared to anyone until long after Mace Windu had died. Ghost Qui-jon only shares the technique with Yoda and Obi-wan, and it takes them almost 20 years to figure it out until ""IV: A New Hope"". So I don´t think that Mace Windu and half the other voices that died in Order 66 could be ghosts, I think Palpatine was imitating those voices just like he imitated Darth Vader and Snoke in Kylo Ren´s head at the start of IX. I think the plot-hole is Palpatine won. Palpatine is also the ghost of Luke that picked the sword and saying that tossing the sword was wrong, Luke´s development of the original trilogy was tossing the sword to not kill Vader, and in Last Jedi was saving the day without using a real sword. Kylo Ren built Starkiller because he did not believe Luke´s pacifism could save the galaxy. So, Luke defeating him with pacifism in The Last Jedi makes sense, and Luke saying he regretted tossing the sword in IX makes it seem as if he regrets not killing Darth Vader, Darth Sidious, and Kylo Ren when he had the chance. It makes more sense if Palpatine is the Luke ghost in IX, and the voices Rey heard could not be the real Jedi voices since as explained above half of them are plot-hole. So most of IX is a big hallucination induced by Palpatine. Palpatine was using the Jedi voices to fool Rey into killing him, to take over her body, because otherwise you have a plot-hole were Palpatine forgets he has the power to imitate voices to manipulate people.

That said I don´t like Episode IX, I think it is really bad. But if it has to be acknowledged, my opinion is Palpatine won is the only way to go. So a post-Sequel trilogy appearance of Grogu would have to deal with all that, in my opinion. And I think that the movie would be more interesting and better if Palpatine just won, otherwise is just Rey being exactly like Luke, evil father and all."

Rey and Kylo were a dyad, and they clearly loved each other at the end.

Years later, Obi-Wan is killed by Darth Vader, and when Luke defeats him(or you could just say next of kin), he becomes the rightful owner. Luke then dies while sitting on a rock and his next of kin would be Leia. Leia then dies and since Han is dead the sword would be passed down to Kylo Ren

529,1614308481.0,StarWarsTheories,"Is Yoda (and possibly Grogu) a Sith? - So I'm going to preface all this by saying that this started off as a joke, but the more I looked into it the more plausible it became, but at the end of the day these are all theories and there's probably no true answer to these questions until the writers outright disprove any of it.

I'm here to revive a somewhat old theory with some new evidence that has been brought to my attention.

The theory about Yoda (and possibly even Grogu) being a Sith.

There are several approaches to this theory, I'll be doing my best at covering each possible point.

Starting with the (very far fetched) assumption that Yoda is Grogu's father, that implies that Yoda would have broken his Jedi vow of celibacy about 10 years before The Phantom Menace (Grogu is 50 years old at the start of Mandalorian, which takes place 5 years after Return of the Jedi, which takes place 35 years before The Phantom Menace). By having broken this vow, this already makes him unable to become a Jedi master. (Even if this part of the theory is wrong, stick with me, it can still work regardless.)

However, with the power of Jedi mind tricks, he could have been able to lie his way to the position of Jedi master as a spy for the Sith. Sure he may have fought a few clones and droids but he had never killed a Sith lord, it was all in order to gain the favor of the Jedi. This would explain why both Palpatine and Yoda were able to survive their encounter rather than resulting in the death of either one. it could all have been a strategically staged fight that resulted in a stalemate, allowing them both to retreat and live longer. (This actually important for later. The relation between Yoda and Palpatine).

Also shouting back to the old Darth Jar Jar theory, it would make more sense if both Yoda and Jar Jar were secretly siths, because as George Lucas said, ""(The sequels) are like Poetry, (they) rhymes."" (I'm a aware that the theory has been mostly disproven, but just for fun entertain the thought why dontcha?)

Skipping ahead a few movies and onto The Mandalorian itself, we see Grogu use force healing, a power that no Jedi up that point has shown up to this point in the movies (shoutout to some deleted user on reddit for pointing this out). I'll just copy/paste what they said because it's almost 3AM and I can't be bothered to rephrase what the post says.

""During his delivery of the Tragedy of Darth Plagueis the Wise in ROTS, Palpatine alludes to a power that Plagueis had to “save the ones he loved from dying”. When Anakin asks if he can learn this power, he says “not from a Jedi.” This clearly implies that it is, for whatever reason, an exclusive power of the Sith, which would explain why the Jedi never used it.

We see Rey use Force Healing numerous times in TROS, and we see Kylo Ren/Ben Solo use it to save Rey from dying. Given that both of them have used Dark Side powers before, and Rey being the granddaughter of Palpatine, it makes sense that they would have the ability to use this Sith power.

But they aren’t the only ones we see using this power. The only other Force user to wield the power of Force healing is, of course, Grogu (aka Baby Yoda). The only explanation is that Baby Yoda is a future Sith Lord, already using the Dark Side in his infancy.""

Link to the post: [https://www.reddit.com/r/StarWarsTheories/comments/gr6h0p/baby\_yoda\_is\_a\_future\_sith\_lord/](https://www.reddit.com/r/StarWarsTheories/comments/gr6h0p/baby_yoda_is_a_future_sith_lord/)

This does bring forwards some interesting evidence, and it would make even more sense if both members of the same species shared similar powers based because they were related.

In addition, later on the show, we are told that Grogu cannot become a Jedi because of his attachment to Din:

""He's formed a strong attachment to you. I cannot train him.""

""What? Why not?""

""His attachment to you makes him vulnerable to his fears. His anger.""

―Ahsoka Tano and Din Djarin, on Grogu

And as we all know, ""Fear is the path to the dark side. Fear leads to anger. Anger leads to hate. Hate leads to suffering."" - Sith Lord Yoda.

By the end of the series, we see Grogu goes with Luke Skywalker to train as a Jedi, which doesn't end well, given the events explained to us in The Last Jedi, where Luke tries to kill Ben Solo, which leads to the desctuction of the Jedi academy and quite possibly the death of Grogu. This would make the next event in The Last Jedi make at least some sense, as Yoda burns down the Jedi texts with lightning (a power more often linked to Siths than any other faction.) out of spite to both Luke for causing the death of his son (or at least the only other known member of his species, other than Yaddle, but who counts Yaddle anyways?). In addition of the relation between Rey and Palpatine confirmed in The Rise of Skywalker, Force Ghost Yoda could have been travelling with Rey without making himself noticed in order to find Luke and avenge the fallen.

I honestly lost track of what I was talking about somewhere around the last paragraph but I hope this all made some sense to you people, or that it at least got a good laugh out of you if not."

I’m hoping we will see Operation Knightfall! The Bad Batch will travel through the galaxy working with Darth Vader to suppress the “Jedi Uprising”. 

We will see the bad batch working for the empire prior then after the clone forces are in the process of being decommissioned we will see a clone revolt beginning on Kamino.

However, if Anakin never fell to the Dark Side and stays a Jedi his whole life, would his Force Potential be even greater as a light side user than as an Uninjured Sith? The way I’ve always interpreted the differences between the light and the dark is that Dark Side gives you quick power results but has a cap on how strong you can get (as well as its physical self-destructiveness), while the light side takes much longer to master, but in the end, your potential is much higher, like how yoda is stronger than Palpatine in ROTS"

537,1613880434.0,StarWarsTheories,"Was Palpatine the reason Shmi was abducted? - Palpatine Responsible for Shmi’s Abduction?

(Also posted in other communities, sorry if you’re seeing it again.)


I originally posted this in Facebook post, so I’m just basically copying and pasting here. I wrote it out of boredom after it had been bouncing around my head for a long time, and I was tired of not getting other people’s opinions on it. It just sort of exploded into this massive clusterfuck of bullet points Those bullet points bounce around in the timeline of the series in no particular order. Just how they occurred to me while writing them. So I apologize if it is hard to follow or anything. I’m not a pro and I’ve never made a post on Reddit before, so sorry for its roughness (and length). 

I originally thought of the idea as I was reading the Vader comic series, and in it we see a progression of Anakin’s life implying Palpatine was responsible for Anakin’s creation while Vader is in the dark side Force realm. That was later expanded on as a common misconception, but it made me wonder what other areas Palpatine had his hands in behind the scenes in Anakin’s life that we didn’t know about. It then occurred to me that, wouldn’t Shmi be a massive target for him? It’s Anakin’s first and greatest weakness (pre-Padme romance) that eventually led to his downfall and started him on the Path of Darkness. We know very little about the things Palpatine was doing behind the scenes in all his machinations across the Galaxy throughout most of the series. I’ve never seen any posts about it or discussing the plausibility of him being the reason Shmi was abducted, so I’d like to hear others’ takes on it as well. Even though I’m sure I’m not the only one this has occurred to. I’ve yet to find any solid evidence of it, but I think there’s quite a bit of circumstantial / implied evidence as shown below, that we can draw 

1 - Timing coincided with the Jango Fett affair, after he orchestrated Kenobi and Anakin to take over security. She would have been taken roughly around the time Kenobi and Anakin came back from Antioch (I think that’s what Palpatine called it, anyways) making it into a very suspicious coincidence when you look at the overall timeframe of Ep. II as a whole. You’re telling me they get back from a mission the same time that not only Shmi is abducted, but Padme’s cruiser gets blown up on a runway, right when Palpatine is able to offer Kenobi and Anakin for her protection?? 

2 - He would have known that hunting Jango, while also protecting Padme from threats Jango hired, would have been tactically impossible without splitting the tasks up between Master and Padawan.  No way the Council lets a Senator into the potential line of fire while on the hunt for Jango, and not knowing how many assassins were coming, protecting her would be the highest priority. He therefore knew the obvious solution would be to split the tasks between Anakin and Kenobi. 

3 - The lines between Palpatine and Anakin: P: “And so! They’ve finally given you an assignment. Your patience has paid off.”
A: “Your guidance more than my patience.”
So Palpatine would have been very aware of where Anakin sat in relation to going out on his own and how the council felt about his taking the trials. Everyone but Kenobi was ready to let Anakin proceed in encumbered, Palpatine would have realized this very quickly based on these statements here. 

4 - We also know that Anakin’s nightmares started shortly before the Fett affair, giving us a rough estimation timeline of events. They had to have started at close to the same time, given the amount of time to organize the hit on Padme, and organize the abduction of Shmi would have taken close to the same amount of time.  The timelines also sync together the rest of the film.
 
5 - Why the hell would the Sand People only abduct Shmi, and ONLY Shmi, while not raiding the house, farm, stealing anything else, or taking any other people??? A raiding party versus three adults other than Shmi?? There was another woman they could have taken in Beru, had they actually been raiding. But they just happened upon her, on her regular daily walk to get mushrooms, at sunrise, in the middle of nowhere? It smacks of isolating her and a planned abduction vs. a typical raiding party. Raiders don’t stop the raid after scoring one thing and leave. They ransack, murder, and steal. The family had speeders, food, and other potential slaves. But only Shmi was taken. Why do it so delicately? If they had taken the rest of the family, who would be there to explain to Anakin what happened to his mother?? She’s be lost forever. 

6 - We know the Sand People are violent opportunists who take whatever they can get, while also hoarding what little resources they have. Why, knowing this, would they keep Shmi alive for a month (given by Owen Lars while telling Anakin what happened)???? Keeping her alive for entertainment is one thing, but they’d let her die of deprivation or sell her back into slavery beforehand if that was her sole value. They wouldn’t waste resources keeping a source of entertainment alive that long. Doing so requires a cost of resources like food and water, among dirt poor tribal culture in the middle of a desert? They’d never waste resources like that, it’s not in their nature. This makes me think they were paid to abduct and hold her for a period of time, not that she was just some random person taken by chance by a raiding party. 

7 - Which brings up another point. The Sand People fought off FORTY farmers trying to get Shmi back!! They didn’t just pay the price in resources, they paid the price in their own (and the farmer’s) BLOOD. No one they were planning on killing for sport or selling into slavery is that valuable to a raiding party. It doesn’t make sense. Why fight so hard to keep her if she was no one? Maybe out of fear of telling a Sith Lord they lost her back to the people they took her from? Maybe they were promised a large payday and didn’t want to lose their benefactor promising to pay them an obscene amount? Abducting her again would give the game away if they lost her and they can’t wipe out the farm, or there’s no one to tell other people she was missing. Sounds like some powerful motivations to keep her to me. 

8 - At the time, we know that Anakin’s attachment to his mother was his first, deepest, and most vulnerable weakness. While advancing through his Jedi training, his dream and his deepest motivation to become a Jedi was to come back and free his mother. He never let go of that attachment, if anything it became more important and sentimental to him as he went along. Killing mom before he had the opportunity to save her would be a powerful nudge towards darkness and an eternity’s worth of guilt to wrack him while going to sleep at night. Especially considering Palpatine was stoking Anakin’s ego and reinforcing his anger for ten years prior to her abduction.

9 - Palpatine pushing Anakin to dark tendencies in his most formative years, stoking his resentment of Kenobi whose hypercritical approach and mistrust of his padawan only helped him, Palpatine knew Anakin was ready to explode. He waited and targeted his mother at the perfect moment, when all that anger, fear, and resentment was at the boiling point, he set it up so there would be no one with him to rein in his emotions as he found out Shmi’s fate. It was the birth of Vader. 

10 - Splitting Anakin and Kenobi was vital to Palpatine’s plans and possibly the largest roadblock he faced when it came to Anakin’s fall. It was the key to everything. Palpatine knew that once he started Anakin on the Path, his fate was sealed. (As Yoda once said, “....Consume you it will!”) Vader’s fate was sealed in that moment. Palpatine owned Anakin after that moment, reflected by Palpatine being the one who Anakin confided in about his mini-genocide, and not in Kenobi. Once Anakin became a Knight there was an ever widening gulf between them. We see it in Anakin’s suspicion and jealousy of Kenobi stopping by Padme’s home unannounced, questioning her on it and when Anakin asks Padme if it was because of Kenobi that she wouldn’t join his schemes to power at the end of RotS. When the council orders him to spy he also subconsciously blamed Kenobi, “Why are you asking this of me?” not “Why is the Council asking this of me?” When Kenobi is chosen to lead the campaign against Grevious instead of Anakin and we see his seething anger and jealousy over it. Whatever Anakin eventually hated Kenobi for, it started with Palpatine’s whispering in his ear and goading his resentment, but his hate truly started at Shmi’s death. Anakin believing Kenobi holding him back had killed his mother was the wedge he used to split them permanently.

11 - Anakin was always a target from the moment Palpatine knew he was the Chosen One. Corrupting him was almost as important as creating the Empire, as it was his greatest, most painful knife in the back of the Jedi Order. He wouldn’t have risked the Chosen One standing against him during the Purge, or thereafter, given the prophecy and what it entailed. It was a blow against the idea of it being Anakin’s destiny to topple the Sith in Palpatine’s own mind, supposedly removing that threat, while flexing his manipulation and cunning muscles in the process. It was also a psychological blow against the Jedi Order to take their champion away from them. He couldn’t resist. He also wouldn’t leave it to fate to decide. We see his hand in Anakin’s deeds over and over again. Why would he ignore such an easy target as Shmi that had the power to tear Anakin apart? At the time, before Padme, it was Anakin’s greatest weakness and no other target would have done so much to turn Anakin as targeting Shmi would have. I don’t know that Anakin would have thought joining the Dark Side to save Padme would have been a price worth paying if Shmi’s death hadn’t happened, or hadn’t been so traumatic. 

12 - We also know that Palpatine had no issue in sadistically making Anakin hurt and making him feel guilty for his failures to protect those close to him. -Evidenced by Palpatine telling Vader that it was he who killed Padme on Mustafar, not that she died elsewhere afterwards, then laughed about it while Vader screamed. Pain was important to the Sith as a channel for hate, rage, and power. He’d have thought nothing of orchestrating Shmi’s death to make Anakin begin to hate. I think this was the real purpose of her abduction all along. Palpatine wouldn’t think twice about betraying Anakin that way, his only concern was for making his hate stronger. 

13 - Back to the Sand People for a moment. We know from the Mandalorian that the Sand People were “brutal but that they have honor (paraphrasing).” Tell me what is honorable about stringing up a defenseless woman and torturing her for a month, for no reason at all? I think they were paid to make her hurt, so that Anakin would be sure to feel her pain through the Force and come running to save her. Without her being tortured, he may not have gotten the message. Maybe they had her for so long without anything happening, that they started torturing her later into her captivity, because her just being kidnapped wasn’t enough to draw Anakin in.

14 - Palpatine would know that after losing his mother, Anakin’s already there fear of loss would intensify by a vast amount. He also likely knew of his infatuation with Padme, since Anakin likely shared these feelings with him, whether intentional or not. Everyone knew Anakin was infatuated with her because it was written all over his face. By removing Shmi in a violent and traumatic way, Anakin would cling even harder to those he loved. Palpatine would have wanted to encourage him to latch onto Padme, knowing that losing her would be the final piece to push Anakin over the edge. The stronger the emotion, the stronger the hate, the stronger the Sith. He made sure Anakin was alone with Padme with no one to check his anger over his loss or his love of Padme, either. 

This is all just a bit too convenient for my tastes. Too many reasons and too many upsides to someone like Palpatine, so I’m curious of your thoughts. I think for the master manipulator Palpatine was, - the man who duped the Galaxy into electing him leader of the Republic, wiped out the Jedi with their own trusted soldiers, and created the Empire from the Republic with nothing but will and guile;-hijacking Anakin’s mother at the critical moment when no one was there to restrain Anakin’s explosive anger and emotion would be a short order. This has been an idea for a long time rattling around my head and I just kept coming up with new reasons to back up my theory, so I wanted to get my thoughts in a row and get it out. Then it turned into this giant thing I just churned out. But, I keep finding more reasons why it’s the only plausible reason she was taken in the first place. Sorry so long. I ramble a lot. If anyone needs clarification I’ll be happy to try and clear things up.

TL;DR: Palps had every opportunity, reason, and resource available to target Shmi on Tatooine, who he knew was Anakin’s first, greatest, and most vulnerable weakness prior to Padme’s romance. I can’t think of any reason he wouldn’t orchestrate it to take advantage and push Anakin onto the path of the Dark Side. It was the perfect opportunity."
538,1613866007.0,StarWarsTheories,"Mortis Arc Continuation With Ahsoka and Ezra? - Hello There Everyone

In celebration of a potential Ezra casting I have a theory 

I think we are going to get some crazy force story taking place on Mortis in Ahsoka. Where we could see a continuation of the struggle between the son and the daughter. 

I think that the Sons life essence was transferred to Ezra maybe through the Sith Holocron or some other means. This would make Ezra the Reincarnation of the son.

We know that Ahsoka has the life essence of the daughter. 

And Kanan is thought to be the reincarnation of the father because of his connection to loth wolves and always kept Ezra in balance.


I think we will get an epic battle between Ahsoka and Ezra with Ezra ultimately being saved 

Could Luke become the true Balancer of the Force after his fathers Death?

540,1613614938.0,StarWarsTheories,"My head cannon/theory: Vader did not save Palpatine -   

Vader was protecting Luke Headcannon

So, join me in this certain point of view…

Full transparency, I am an old OG Trilogy head and hold a higher opinion of the Prequel Trilogy than the Sequel Trilogy for the crazy amounts of plot holes and retcons it forced. BUT, I have been conceiving a headcannon that lets me appreciate the ST more and lines everything up more so than the current sequence of events with the world between worlds and all the Filoni/Favreau saves. Also, if I make any contradictions, ramblings or just nonsense, I have been conceiving this headcannon while dabbing. Also, I am not sure if this is a current theory/headcannon or if it runs similar to others but I am not trying to copy anyone else's.

Main concept: In ROTJ, When Luke was about to strike down the Emperor, Vader blocked the killing blow not because he was protecting the Emperor but rather protecting Luke from the Emperor. This theory came to me in a sativa fueled debate with several other Star Wars mega fans. 

Starting in the ROTJ throne room where the Emperor is egging Luke on to “strike him down and to give into his hatred so that his journey toward the dark side would be complete.” Considering that Vader, a dude who hated his master, who was constantly dogged, tested, degraded, and insulted, was supposed to keep him from being killed is a huge risk. Palpatine, in knowing the rule of two would know that Vader and Luke would in turn rule the galaxy if he just didn’t turn on his lightsaber—which would absolutely ruin how whole “live forever plan.” Also considering all of the artifacts and devices that led Kylo and the Resistance to Exogal were present on the Second Death Star would lead me to believe that…

**Palpatine did not want to simply have him and Vader continue the rule of two without him, he wanted Luke to kill him because he unlocked the secret to transfer his essence to Luke.** The consolation prize for Vader blocking Luke’s blow was that Luke and Vader fought and he would have a stronger apprentice. Like, let’s get real, when Palpatine said “take your Jedi weapon...I am defenseless.” Yea, no way is he defenseless. He could easily whoop Vader’s ass if he felt the need. But he also saw the potential of Luke like he saw in Anakin and that it would surpass them both. Vader somehow learned of this and wanted to save his son by yeeting Palps down the shaft. **He wanted to save Luke from becoming Sidious.** 

In the Prequel Trilogy, I believe that Palpatine had indeed discovered force essence transfer but had not fully unlocked the secret. When he egged on Anakin to kill Dooku, he thought he had perfected the technique but was disappointed and if you look at the movie right after he beheads him, you can see Palpatine look like he is closing his eyes and waiting for something to happen and almost confused and disappointed. Perhaps it was he who needed to be killed in anger to allow his essence to transfer? Then Anakin and Dooku’s blade are deactivated and Palpatine shifts gears to make Anakin his new apprentice since the essence transfer did not take. 

This was the expectation for what occurred in the throne room in ROTJ. The Emperor had solved what issues that prevented him from taking Anakin and was confident that he was not risking himself by allowing himself to be killed. Remember, the dark side of the force is a pathway to many abilities that some consider to be unnatural. By allowing himself to be killed, he would survive indefinitely. Also consider that Qui-Gon, a grey Jedi who did not toe the Jedi counsel line was the one who discovered the ability to live indefinitely by sacrificing themselves. Yet another pathway to many abilities that some consider to be unnatural. Sidious was ready to get the even newer, more improved model Skywalker and would also remain more powerful that Vader. Again keep in mind all of the information, all of the devices and artifacts that appeared in the Rise of Skywalker were present in the throne room at the time he tried to transfer into Luke.

This addresses the repetitive criticism of the ST for me. It was not just fan service and recycled ideas but Palpatine was deliberately setting the same stage, pulling the same strings and forcing the same proxy wars all to transfer his essence into a younger, stronger and more formidable Emperor that can live and dominate the galaxy forever. Afterall, he tried to bait, goad and influence Rey to do the exact same things that he tried to get Anakin to do and failed due to his misunderstanding of the process and with Luke but he was ultimately saved and protected by his father, Anakin.

541,1613607448.0,StarWarsTheories,"Why (Spoiler) Stays So Young Compared To Obi-wan - So in the Mandalorian Season two, one thing that came up was how Bo-Katan looks so young when compared to Alec Guiness' Obi-Wan.  Now we know that this is because Katee Sackhoff is that age and she played the voice in Clone Wars etc. It was great casting, and she did a fantastic job. But we wanted to take a quick stab at an in universe explanation as to why she appears so young and have a bit of fun with it. If you want a fast track on this check out a video we did on the subject earlier \[[https://youtu.be/YosUguDExlQ](https://youtu.be/YosUguDExlQ)\]

Splitting this into two sections, Obi-Wan & Bo:

OK so first Obi-wan:

Obi-Wan has experienced a hard life with a lot of loss, his master, the love of his life, the entire order he dedicated his life to and chose over the love of his life and most importantly his brother. The one person that meant the most to him. This level of stress is bound to affect how a person looks. 

Next we've got the lifestyle of Obi-Wan. He's living as a hermit in the harsh environment of Tatooine, the heat, two suns with all that UV exposure. The local food and limited water sources. Being exposed to this for around 18/19 years is going to have a dramatic affect on the aging process. 

Next looking at Bo-Katan Kryze:

Again, Bo has what could be considered a hugely stressful life, suffering many of the same style of losses as Obi-Wan, losing first her sister, then her leader and her order, then her planet. She then gains the title of Mandalore and loses it again. So we got to agree that she has suffered just as much as Obi-Wan in this department. 

Next with Bo-Katan's lifestyle. This is where we divert a little from Obi-Wan. Bo-Katan is essentially living in a full set of Mandalorian armour protecting her from harsh environments such as UV light etc. She is also probably battling quite a bit while being on the run, after battles she may spend prolonged periods of time in a bacta tank. This will improve her skin condition etc helping to halt the aging process. 

The big thing we thing that makes a difference is that she is travelling in hyperspace a lot. Being on the run or gathering Mandalorians or Chasing after the darksaber etc. Hyperspace is defined as ""An alternate dimension that could only be reached by traveling at or faster than the speed of light."" This means that Bo would spend a lot of time travelling at the speed of light. Now if we look at the [twin paradox](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Twin_paradox) traveling at 90% the speed of light will reduce your aging by around 44%. So if Bo is spending weeks or months at hyper space while Obi-Wan is living purely on Tatooine for 18/19 years it would make sense that she ages far less. 

So that's our stab at why Bo ages so much slower than Obi-Wan. Hope I've made some sense anyway. What do you guys think?"
542,1613533082.0,StarWarsTheories,"Why Kylo Ren’s Scar Moved - 
This is based off of a comment I saw under an old post, but it was more simple.

So as we know, everything in Star Wars canon needs an explanation. While of course the real reason for the scar movement is just because it looks better over the eye as opposed to the nose, that is not how canon works, and there needs to be an in-universe fact.

So my theory is that after his duel with Rey, Kylo Ren force healed his face and erased the wound and scar. Upon seeing that Kylo did this, Snoke (Palpatine) punished him by giving him a new scar, but of course not in the exact same spot. The lingering scar and pain would be to remind him of his failure permanently, or at least for a long time."
543,1613356456.0,StarWarsTheories,"The Landspeeder - Cleigg Lars was shopping for a Landspeeder at Watto’s shop when he saw a beautiful and kind slave woman, ~~Schmi~~ Shmi Skywalker, who told him the flashy speeder he was looking at was broken garbage, and showed him to a more humble, but reliable model.

He found himself coming back for parts he didn’t need, and realized he really was coming back for her. He cut a deal with Watto, who, since Anakin was gone, had really missed the boy and fallen into depression. He also got himself into some more gambling trouble betting against the Hutts and had to pay up. He sold a lot of things at a loss and as he told Cleigg Lars, “It’s true, I could-a use the money!”

He was reluctant to let Schmi go, but Cleigg offered him far more than the aging slave was worth, and had been a regular customer who paid up front.

He lost his shop, but still made a humble living fixing power converters and his Toydarian tenacity didn’t let him quit.

He still blamed the Jedi for his loss of Anakin and he regretted selling Schmi, but he worked his way back into a respectable pod racer shop, and started customizing T-16s for the latest fad of Canyon Runs, as the Empire was recruiting Tatooine farmboys to become Pilots.

Business was going well, and he was happy. He even got some funding from the Empire as he was known to hate both the Former Galactic Republic Rebels for failing to protect Toydaria as they promised, and the Jedi for their betrayal of the same Republic and his personal grudge against Qui-Gon Jinn.

He thought he would never have to see another Jedi, was sure they were all dead, which gave him a grim satisfaction. Then in walks Obi-Wan Kenobi with a Landspeeder to sell. Watto recognized the speeder and shook his head in disbelief. He practically stole it off the Jedi, who seemed to be in a hurry.  He was sure the Jedi would meet his end, and called the Imperial Garrison to report him."

I may sound crazy but in a short clip posted by star wars we see Ben Solo rescuing and freeing these blue butterflys they also can be seen in the mandalorian when grogu is meditating which could lead to a Grogu/Ben connection but we will get to that in a other theory it also would explain why he wasn't in the rise of skywalker ending because I think he will appear to Rey in a future movie/tv show or comic also a butterfly also means rebirth so maybe Ben will come back later [This video explains it in greater detail and how Ben and Grogu are very similar (https://youtu.be/5OWCmPsb2uQ)but yeah just a short theory.

555,1612150882.0,StarWarsTheories,"Jedi Breeding Program - I have been thinking about this a lot the last couple of years. Obviously, the Jedi forbid attachments and therefore wouldn't allow members to marry or have children especially not to other members of the order. 

When a highly force-sensitive individual has children they seem to also have force sensitivity in nearly all the cases I can think of with one exception. Rey's father the son of Palpatine didn't seem to be force sensitive. So other than that every other case I have come up with seem to be force sensitive as long as the parent is and the more force-sensitive the parent the more force-sensitive the child seems to be.

Now with that foundation established it to me begs the question why didn't the Jedi use breeding to continue/expand the order. Now keep in mind I'm not talking just post ROTS here I'm talking at the height or before the height of the order. So you have plenty of male and female Jedi and advanced technology which would allow for the use of IVFstyle technology to mix and match whatever combinations of sperm and egg they choose. AND because they have such sophisticated bacta and cloning tech in the star wars galaxy they probably wouldn't even need surrogates or the female Jedi to carry them. Now keep in mind I am not suggesting cloning or eliminating the intake of new babies/children into the order so you would be able to maintain genetic diversity and avoid inbreeding with careful consideration of not using the sperm and eggs of any Jedi that could be too closely related. This would give the order a consistent supply of babies AND they could overtime increase the force sensitivity/ midi-chlorian count of the order by using only the genetic material of those with the highest midi-chlorian counts. 

The order could also avoid problems of attachments by not telling any of the members of the order whose sperm and eggs were used to parent each baby. That way even if you ended up with a padawan that was or could be your child you should never know. The only problem I can think of with this is Jedi being force sensitive might still know somehow.

Now the only objection I can think of to this that isn't external to star wars i.e. part of it being created fictional universe is it not being the will of the force. The Jedi may have seen this sort of thing as being unnatural and going against the will of the force. Otherwise, it seems like it could have had a lot of benefits for the order.

I would love to know if anyone can come up with any other in-universe reasons why it wouldn't work or objections the order might have to this sort of operation.

556,1612138468.0,StarWarsTheories,"Always two there are; no more, no less. - JarJar Binks and Grogu will be revealed to be the two remaining Sith Lords.

It has already been theorized that there is a connection by greater theorists than myself, but what if Reddit’s enthusiasm for JarJar and Grogu has actually influenced the creators enough to make Darth JarJar actually happen?

Grogu fits all the requirements for ending up a Sith like Anakin.  He is too old to complete his training (though it is assumed he started early enough). He has an unhealthy (from a Jedi standpoint) attachment to Din Djarin.
He must have survived Order 66 and Anakin somehow, and therefore he has suffered a terrible loss because of Jedi failure. Quite possibly another loss with Luke if he was at the Temple around when Kylo Ren destroyed it.

He also seems not to care for the life of other creatures. When he felt the life of the eggs with the Force, he just decided they were for him to eat.  It was to me, the most disturbing episode of the whole show from a Force standpoint, even more than Ahsoka rejecting him.

Yoda was pretty explicit that there were always two Sith. Was it just a statement of current affairs, or something more prophetic?

Other options for him being saved are Jacosta Nu, who I don’t think could have evaded Anakin, and Mace Windu, who I don’t think would have crawled back from falling to the Underworld in time.  Perhaps Yaddle, but isn’t that a bit too same-samesies to be interesting?  JarJar could have easily gotten away and decided to groom his apprentice. The way Grogu eats everything in sight also reminds me of JarJar when he tried to eat the gorg on Tatooine.

557,1612128295.0,StarWarsTheories,"The Disney plus crossover won't retcon the sequels. It will improve them. Hear me out - However you feel about the sequels, whether you love or hate them, you can't deny they were quite controversial. And fans that didn't like them want them decanonised. And a lot of these fans think that the disney plus crossover event with the ahsoka show, rangers of the new republic and mando will retcon them. My theory is that they'll improve the plot. Hear me out.

My theory is that this crossover will focus on the war against the grysk and will be set up by Ahsoka .

So the good guys unite, beat the grysk.And then they split. 

Mando goes back to being mando, since that doesn't affect the skywalker saga and we can finish that story in however seasons Jon favreau wants. 

And THIS is how the ending of this crossover will improve the sequel trilogy :

The rangers of the new republic now becomes about how the new republic gets weaker and weaker because of all the ressources they spent on the war with the grysk and starts to show its cracks to set the stage for the takeover by the first order.

Ahsoka will have multiple seasons (i mean she's so popular they can't not). And they will be about exploring the unknown regions and creating a grey order there and forming young force sensitive children which would explain why the sequels show so little professional force users (other than the fact that half of them got obliterated by kylo) because most of them would be in the unknow regions.

So thats my theory. This is my first post here so i would appreciate feedback. I think this is really fun and hoped you enjoyed reading this. May the force be with you !"
558,1612090906.0,StarWarsTheories,"Sidious Cementing Anakin as Vader - So I’m not sure if anyone’s already said/thought of this but it always annoyed me until I came up with this. Sorry if this is glaringly obvious but...

In ROTS when Vader asks where Padmè is Darth Sidious responds “It seems, in your anger, you killed her.” I always wondered why he said this when he couldn’t possibly know for sure what kills her (or if he does, knowing it wasn’t directly Anakins behaviour) and why the detail of it being Anakin that was  necessary. I’m aware that canon says she dies of a broken heart. I’m also aware that there are fan theories stating that Sidious takes her life force to save Anakin/Vader. 

Regardless of how Padmè dies what Sidious does is incredibly smart because Anakin would absolutely hate himself for destroying the one he loves and we all know that hate and anger are imperative to the dark side. Sidious essentially traps Vader in his own hate and anger for himself knowing that Anakin will never be able to forgive (or let go) of the fact he kills Padmè basically binding him to the dark side. It also makes Vader a whole lot stronger with the dark side and probably a ton more ruthless. He can now follow a path of self destruction unhindered and full of hatred for everyone and everything especially himself.

  too hateful in comments it would be  
  appreciated, thanks.

Just watched the Mortis Arc Storyline and immediately realized that maybe the son is future Anakin , the daughter is Padme & the father is a mix between both Qui gon jinn and Obi wan kenobi.

Now some of the big points that lead to this thought were when the son meets with the father and argues and eventually attacks him with force lightning while shouting "" I hate you "" which is what Anakin would shout when he and Obi wan later fight during the battle of the fates.

The next is when the son is about the kill the father after acquiring the knife but as he is about to do so the daughter intervines and is killed accidentally which both saddens and enrages the son , The same later happens somewhat on Mustafar where Obi wan confronts Anakin and after some talk Anakin becomes aggressive and is about to try kill him but padme comes out (intervines) and is caught in Anakins aggresion and is killed accidentally which both saddens and enrages him.


The next is when Anakin goes to the darkside well where the son lingers about and upon arrival its a lava like river with a very heavy Mustafar like appearance and soon the son shows himself to Anakin and shows him what he is to do and become which finally turns him to the dark side to join with the son for what he believes will achieve peace and prevent these visions , The somewhat similar happens later to Anakin where he is defeated on Mustafar and is left mutilated and beaten by his master obi wan which completely enrages him which inturn destroyed any light side left in him and he now becomes fully dark side , Palpitine will come to his rescue but he is only his manipulator as Anakin confides in telling him his visions and dark dreams inturn Palpitine tells him he can help him stop these visions and perhaps help him save Padme but he too is just manipulating Anakin the same way the son had to get him to join him on/in the darkside. 

Im sure there are lots more pieces to make this theory seem more of a possible chance upon further looking at things around this story arc and others connected to it. I'm open to criticism and thoughts on this."

565,1611813688.0,StarWarsTheories,"How Maul will play into Kenobi series - At the beginning of Rebels we find Maul, a broken old man who has somehow lost the massive crime syndicate he had previously. But how did he lose it? 

Here’s my theory. In the show we will follow Obi Wan doing his existential stuff of course, and then Vader trying to track him down. This will lead Vader to find Maul, maybe thinking Maul has some knowledge about Kenobi’s whereabouts.

But Maul has no idea that Obi Wan survived. Vader finds Maul, fights him, and the empire proceeds to destroy Crimson Dawn. Maul survives, earning the name “The Shadow” that the inquisitors in Rebels refer to him as. As a result of the destruction of his criminal syndicate, Maul flees which leads him to where he is at the start of rebels, stranded on Malachor. 

Maul has just learned from Vader something important, that Obi Wan might still be alive. This makes him go crazy to find Obi Wan again - connecting directly into Rebels where he attempts to find him. 

I think all of this connects way too seamlessly for it not to happen. If it doesn’t I think it’s a pretty big missed opportunity. 

Essentially, Vader’s goal will no doubt be to find Obi Wan. How can this not lead to Maul? We also have so many unanswered questions between Solo and Rebels. How did Maul lose Crimson Dawn so fast? How else then Vader. 

The only thing that makes this theory potentially impossible is the timeline. Since it’s 10 years after ROTS, that means it’s before Solo. And Maul obviously still has Crimson Dawn at that time. But maybe he has way less of it? I still highly doubt Vader doesn’t come into contact with Maul along his journey to find Obi Wan."

Or maybe Maul kills both and continues to menace the Jedi. If Dooku was still in the order at that time I think he would’ve been sent to Naboo (like how Kenobi and Anakin were sent on missions together even after Anakin was a knight with his own Padawan).

571,1611548370.0,StarWarsTheories,"Mace Windu's lightsaber is a result of him bleeding the crystal. - Mace Windu to me is one of the coolest jedi in canon. Coming from a world with two warring factions as a baby he was trained to be a jedi at the temple in corusant. When he reached the age of becoming a padawan he was hand selected by the jedi grand master himself Yoda. 

Mace was strange though, he actually enjoyed fighting especially lightsaber combat and would revel in the challenge and besting of other jedi in sparring. Yoda believing this would lead Windu to close to the dark side chose to train him in form 7 lightsaber combat, windu developed form 7 into his own fighting style called Vaapad. Vaapad could draw on the dark side within either the user or opponent to increase the strength of the user. Yoda saw that Mace now could channel that dark side energy into a more positive aspect and Mace became widely regarded as the best swordsman of the jedi order (its debatable that Anakin was a better swordsman but they were undoubtably the best two) this shows us that 1. Mace Windu did have to use the dark side and channel it through his light saber and 2. He used his lightsaber very often.

Here is my theory, Mace Windu originally had a blue saber and as he used Vaapad more and more his channeling of the darkside through his saber and crystal ended up bleeding the crystal purple. This could explain why purple blades were so rare because you had to use the dark side to bleed it while not actually falling to the dark side.

To back up my claims I have a few points:
1. Obi wan and Rey are the only major characters to have a British accent in the movies

2. Satine probably didn’t have any other loves since obi wan, and never talked of any husbands or boyfriends leading me to believe that obi wan knocked her up

3. Reys strong connection to the force would be more believable if she had two powerful force user relatives rather then just one

4. Rey was just like obi wan she grew up from basically nothing and was pulled into a major story

573,1611431494.0,StarWarsTheories,"What should happen after the sequels? - Personally i don't like the sequels but they exist is canon regardless so hear is my thoughts on what should happen in the future.

So theres going ti be a large time jump again such as 30-40 years or so. Rey in that time ignored the teachings of Luke and started her own academy of jedi with Ahsoka and probably grogu. Maybe also some fan favorites who are still alive like Ezra or Kanan. We will see where they differ in teaching styles and what appears to be a better order of Jedi then seen before. 

The sequels make it clear that the sith are gone completely and there are no dark side users left so I believe the enemy should be based on the invasion of the Yuuzhan Vong in the comics. A cruel race of aliens from the wilds of space that unite the remanants of the first order along with whatever government is ruling the galaxy at the end of the sequels. 

During the invasion the jedi will be targeted and drug into yet another war to defend the galaxy. This invasion will last a trilogy resulting in the required heroic deaths of some of our hereos who are still alive along with some new characters earning there places amoung the greats by actually fighting in battles and needing to seecthe horrors of war. But one of the jedi will get captured and tortured but thought to be dead. At the very end of the last movie the invaders will be defeated and we will be greeted by a force sensitive that has been tortured by a race that finds nothing but joy in seeing them in pain. This jedi will fall to the dark and use the same ability Cere used when she saw Trilla was the 2nd sister. 

I think this could do justice to the characters that are around while setting up an intriguing future of the galaxy. It also changes the star wars universe by making stormtroopers and rebels along with jedi and innocents to fight alongside eachother against a terrifying enemy but resulting in the creation of a dark lord once again. It would basically serve to repair the universe and i think the one to fall to the dark side should be reys child, or the great grand child of palpatine."

Since we know Kenobi will be travelling off world for his rematch of the century...he's going to need a ship. He can either hire someone ala han in ANH or he already has a ship. I'm betting on the ladder and it will be Soulless One. 
Soulless One was last scene docking into the hanger of the Tantive III and later on the Tantive III takes obi, Yoda and bail to Naboo. From there they appear to go their separate ways with Obi taking Luke to Tatooine. How did he get there?

I doubt bail dropped him and Yoda off at their respective planets as that would be heat considering Jedi are now enemies and they are trying to keep the twins split up. Taking a Naboo ship would be too flashy and draw attention landing on Hutt controlled Tatooine.
The most likely scenario is Obi Wan taking a small non Republic star fighter to Tatooine which would be Soulless One.

The Clone Wars is one of the most important wars of canon and Jango Fett one of the most important people involved, considering the clones were like 99% of the reason that Palpatine was able to actually topple the Jedi order. If Clone Wars was taught as a class about an actual war you’d definitely have to remember who he is.

Luke grew up in a post-purge galaxy. Information about the jedi would have been extremely restricted and almost never positive. He had no idea what the force was. He just wanted to be a pilot. He was a farmhand.

So, Luke’s skills? Piloting and mechanics. What do those need? Concrete thinking. Heavy constraints. Even as a pilot, he’d be restricted in what he was capable of according to basic physics.

What about the Jedi?

It’s all about faith and philosophy.

Luke went from being an aerospace engineering major with a minor in mechanics and mechanical engineering, to seminary, without ever having even seen a Bible.

Grogu is “safe”, Bo-Katan has the Cruiser for retaking Mandalore, Boba Fett is rearmored, and I don’t think Thrawn has any interest in keeping someone like Gideon in his ranks.

582,1611246081.0,StarWarsTheories,"CIS WERE THE GOOD GUYS... In a way - I know i just posted, i don't think im going to argue this one though because it kinda holds itself.

So first ill start with the problems im this theory or really the only problem. The generals of the cis were ruthless murderers and most were pure evil with an exception to dooku. (i'll get to dooku later) but the main problem is grievous really. He was a cold hearted killer BUT thats why the seperatists used him. 

Ok so lets get on with the theory. My theory is that the worlds that supported the Cis were actually right to do so. The people of the galaxy had long lost faith in both the jedi and the republic and for us viewers of the movie we don't know an exact reason these worlds wanted to seperate. Some worlds have been given more in depth amswers then others but the reasoning is vague at best. But think about it. If they won the war palpatine wouldve lost all his power im the republic, since he had all the power he had basically made himself into the perfect scapegoat for the republic to put the loss on. 

Now lets go to dooku. Im the comics i know of two apprentices dooku had. Ventress and Quinlan Voss. Technically i guess there was also savage but that was a trap and then he also trained grievous in lightsaber training. But dooku having apprentices shows something that is weird about his character. He was actively breaking the rule of two, and working to overthrow palpatine as master. But theres other weird stuff about dooku. Honour is incredibly important to him as a sith, almost more so then when he was a jedi. He also never really talks about the dark side the way others do, he says he lost faith in the jedi order not that he had a love for the dark side although im sure he was corrupted to some extent. But hes the weirdest thing about dooku. He is the only sith that despises his sith name. He is only called Darth Tyranous a handful of times in the books, comics movies and show he is almost always refered to as count dooku. 

So heres a very far fetched theory. The CIS were the first people to fight against palpatine, they didn't have enough population to maintain an army so they used droids which is actually a pretty kind move for your own citizens. Rather then putting people into harms way they made the droid army which was meant to be a defense force since ""seperatists"" usually dont invade a bunch of places but Palpatines interference in placing his underlings in the general positions he was able to use the trust of dooku and grievous to just keep sending them on suicide missions to weaken the army, making the banking clans buy more droids or build more depending on the system. They are made to be the bad guys but in reality we were rooting for darth vader and his stormtroopers the whole show just before they became evil... Why are we rooting for baby hitler? Seriously why didnt we cheer for the CIS like we cheered for the rebels since the people behind Palpatines generals only wanted freedom from the tyranny of palpatine and the republic along with not having there children taken at birth to a distant world to be brainwashed into a space wizard who they will never see again since they aren't allowed attachments... Well its easy, you make a good cause but make there war hereos terrifying and evil and you can turn the galaxy and the fanbase against the faction that could have brought peace. I say peace because if dooku managed to kill palpatine itd be safe to say he might keep his sense of honour after taking control which could of resulted in a more stable government with more open trade between individual worlds along with more freedom for individual systems instead of the literal facist empire that took control.

(fun fact about Quinlan Voss and Ventress, in the comics they tempt eachother to opposite sides if the force Quinlan turning to the dark for a short time while Ventress turned to the light. The two fell deeply in love and were planning on running off together but Ventress dies saving Quinlan and also bringing him back to the light side. Quinlan returns to the jedi temple and is kept on close watch but it is unclear if he survived order 66)"

When he is rescued in Clone Wars he is still just as much as a sith as before and thats not where im focusing this theory. Instead im basing it from the time between when Savage dies to when Maul himself dies. 

When Savage dies I believe Maul began getting tempted by the light side. There is evidence to this too. So first his facial expression when Savage calls him a monster with his dieing words. Maul seems so hurt by this accusation, as if he didn't actually believe he was evil before. Its well known that the sith and jedi believe the other is evil which gives both sides a hero complex. Maul wanted to control the galaxy at the side of his master and found joy in killing not in power. But after Savage dies theres a problem i have with Killing and revenge being what drives him. He stops trying to kill people, he rules mandalore pretty well actually wanting life to be better for a lot of lower class mandalorians which is completely out of character for a sith. When he fights Ahsoka in season 7 of the clone wars he stops fighting multiple times only trying to run away and not fight her until he really doesn't have a choice but to fight her. Heres another problem, Maul has killed jedi masters, knights and padawans of many different skill levels, some of which were specifically extremely skilled in lightsaber combat or had very powerful force abilities... So how did Ahsoka manage to beat him unless he wasnt trying? He even gives her an opening to push him to his death but she saves him instead. 

Lets move on though because this doesnt prove anything yet... So there is a large gap in what we know Maul was doing between order 66 and his appearance in star wars Rebels. This is a gap of about 15 years give or take a year. When he introduces himself he says ""its just Maul now"" proving that he no longer considers himself a sith. Also he appears to have much more knowledge about the light side of the force in Rebels. Mostly with how he was one of the few people in canon or legends to figure out the world between worlds. But this is my big one that proves my theory.

The merging of the jedi and sith holocron... I think this is meant to be a metaphor for Maul himself bringing both the light and dark side into balance within himself. No one has ever done that in any other star wars book, comic, movie show or fanfiction. Why is this? Well its because both the sith and the jedi believe that its a misuse of the force. The Jedi knew of the practice but outlawed it because they considered that practice a dark sided art, the sith believed that the light sided holocrons are corrupted by the light side and usually only search for a jedi holocron if it has very specific information on it like the holocrons that contain the list of force sensitive children is a priority to the sith because the information is valuable but not the holocron.

So what do we really have here though, Maul has clearly changed his ways at some point, Revenge doesn't even seem like his main focus anymore rather he wants an apprentice more then anything which we see when he trys to take Ezra as an apprentice, but Ezra is special too for this. Why does Maul want Ezra as an apprentice when Ezra is undoubtably strong with the light side of the force unless maul actually believed he could align Ezra with his new viewpoint on the force, the same thing happens with Ashoka during there fight on Mandalore where he tries to make her his apprentice instead of killing her who is also strong with the light.

So Maul was left knowing that his desperate attempt at taking over the dark side would never work out for him, he lost everything to the dark side twice in his life, first in episode 1 and then again when palpatine kills his entire home world population. He only knew the dark side so his powers never changed nor did his tendencies or personality. But his motives changed. And his motives changed so drastically that i believe he was possibly the only force wielder to become a gray jedi who only used the dark side of the force. And i believe this because the definition of a gray jedi in canon is ""a force wielder who doesn't belong to any organization"" organizations being limited to ones that deal with the force basically. 

I will say that this is just my own theory and there is a lot of evidence pointing that he was more of a dark jedi then a gray including how his revenge still drove him to find and fight kenobi which is one of the only things that go against my gray jedi theory EXCEPT Mauls final words. He could have said a million things to kenobi, the man who took his legs, took his abilities, broke both Maul and his mind then he was left for dead on a planet of garbage for a decade because of this man. Yet he never speaks to kenobi as an enemy. They talk as if they are old friends until they fight. Maul is beaten and as he dies he discovers the existence of 'The Chosen One' who will bring balance to the force. And he says that ""he will avenge us"". Maul showed in his final moments that what he truly wanted was for balance to be brought to the force, why would a dark sider want balance in the force when dark siders are meant to want to destroy the jedi. Maul possibly had the most complex redemption arc to ever grace a screen yet it seems like most people choose to ignore it.


You dont need to read this part its not apart of the theory.
(I'd like to say that i didnt like Mauls death at all, Maul was actually the only person fighting palpatine for the longest time and everyone thought he was evil, he united the criminal leaders to his side trying to free the galaxy from palpatine before he could take over and all in all hes not evil to me at all and i think Maul is more of a jedi then anyone on the high council since the high council endorsed genocide and a militirisation of the entire jedi order effectively making the jedi order nothing more then a cult army on a religous crusade against the sith for a disagreement about the force from thousands of years ago. The jedi aren't peacekeepers because they drug the galaxy into war and then brought that war to countless innocent planets. Maul only seems like a bad guy because we believed him to be at the time and didn't realize how aligned he was with the light side in his motivations, i just think he  wasnt able to connect with the light side of the force after corrupting his soul so much to the dark side )

Edit: yes ik arguing my point in the comments, if you disagree you have every right too, lets argue this shit bro prove me wrong or prove me righe idc. I messed up on Savages dieing words, you can find the real quote in the comments. And im sorry if i don't get around to replying to you but thanks so much for all your imput."
585,1611042379.0,StarWarsTheories,"Theory Regarding Qui-Non Kneeling Scene in Phantom Menace - I am a relatively casual Star Wars fan who just finished watching Phantom Menace. Even as a casual, Qui-Gon's death has always puzzled me. It is my firm belief that when Qui-Gon kneels while separated from Darth Maul by a shield, he is not merely meditating as others before me have posited. Rather, he is connecting with the Force to turn the tide of the battle of Naboo. 

As soon as Qui-Gon begins to connect with the Force, we see Padme and her cohort capture the throne room, when before they appeared trapped and arrested.  We also see 'lil Ani (Anakin) destroy the central energy unit on the command ship, while before the kneeling scene, he is helplessly surrounded by droids. 

Finally, this theory is rounded out by evidence from episode VIII ""The Last Jedi"", in which Luke connects with the Force in a similar way to influence the outcome of the battle. Luke's exhaustion after connecting with the Force on such an extreme level could explain why Qui-Gon loses his fight against Maul: he had concentrated so hard in the kneeling scene that his senses were weakened. 

This theory is far from complete: the question still remains regarding why Qui-Gon does not disappear like other Jedi who have fulfilled their purpose. Does this mean that he was meant to train Anakin? Would things have turned out differently or perhaps in accordance with Jedi prophesy? These are the questions I will let more dedicated redditors and Star Wars theoreticians answer."

So I was thinking maybe there’s another reason Luke Skywalker, the new hope would even think of killing his nephew. In the force awakens we see Han and Leia haven’t exactly been living happily ever after, so I think Han had an affair, got another girl pregnant and had Ben, Leia would still see him as a son because she takes care of everyone in TROS we see Rey is almost like a daughter to her, at least enough for Rey to take the skywalker name, and Ben could have never known, he could have still had this connection with leia, who he would believe to be his mother, she still would have raised him. This would give Luke a reason to not see the good in him, because family means everything to Luke and Ben is the physical representation of how his best friend hurt his sister. It explains why Luke doesn’t choose to see the good in Ben and why Han and leia don’t have their happily ever after. I think this fixes the biggest problem with TLJ and still fits the entire story."

But now to the theory: Many signs already show that Star Wars and E. T. only play at different times in the same universe.  In my theory lies in E. T. The answer to the question ""When does Star Wars play?""  E. T. was released in theaters in 1982.  It is known to many Star Wars fans that E. T. meets a Yoda disguise on Halloween and thinks he is the real one.  Star Wars Episode I also features E. T.'s species in the Galactic Senate.  For me, Yoda is too young to have ever met E. T.  So I suspect the Yoda E. T. recognized was Grogu.  Since Yoda's species is around 900 years old, this theory suggests that Star Wars is set around 1000 AD.  Another possibility would be that E. T. realized Yoda himself.  Then we would be around the year 0 and the popular meme of the space Jesus named Obi-Wan Kenobi could come true.  These two considerations must be considered individually.

At first he is supposedly 'possessed' but this is probably his real self and he later puts on an act to make Anakin and Padmé think Rish Loo is evil. I think he and the other Gungans worked together and were actually planning on attacking the Naboo. There's btw no way Rish Loo could actually have secret calls with Dooku cause Gungan City consist of see through bubbles.

Once Anakin is captured it is Lyonie who eventually convinces Padmé to trade Grievous for Anakin. This leads Anakin to still become Vader (probably even enhanced his want to save Padmé cause she too didn't go with her duty but saved him) and it also gives Grievous back to the CIS which prevents the Jedi from winning the war before Palpatine was ready to execute Order 66.

This leads me too believe that the Gungans all are in on Palpatine's plan and helped him play both sides."
592,1610769639.0,StarWarsTheories,"Kaminoan Clone Problem - The Kaminoans made millions of clones for the republic, but we know from modern science that cloning is an interesting process. Each clone (or attempt at a clone) requires a separate egg cell from a female donor to produce a clone. In our world, cloning has a less than 0.5% success rate, but seeing as the Kaminoans are no strangers to cloning, I would see it as safe to say they could have as high as a 50% success rate with clones. (We know it can’t be 100%. 99 and the bad patch prove this). This is alarming. The Kaminoans need to get human egg cells from somewhere, and they need millions of them. There can’t possibly be enough volunteering donors to supply an entire army of clones, so I believe it is likely the Kaminoans stole eggs from involuntary human women. They likely went into secluded towns in the far corners of the galaxy, places that wouldn’t be noticed by the major factions of the galaxy, and kidnapped women for their cloning project.

595,1610646447.0,StarWarsTheories,"Kenobi series theory. Potential spoilers - For the obi wan kenobi series i dont think they will have him sitting on tatooine going through PTSD. I think he would be involved with searching for other jedi and ferrying them to safety. I belive he will continually do this while suffering from PTSD

This way we could get some cool inquister vs jedi fights. 

Also i think that he will potentially meet a jedi or two that he will rescue and take them to where he belives it is safe but the jedi will fall to the darkside joining the empire's inquisters and giving away the location of the save zone Obi sets up for survivers of order 66. The jedi their will be massacred by Vader and his Inquisters and Obi Wan will go into hiding again having failed to save the jedi he took care of.


Its a little bleak ish but i think Obi Wan's story will always be layered in traumatic events. Every good thing Obi has done has been in the mids of terrible events. Defeats Maul his master dies. Defeats Anakin his temple and fellow jedis are massacred. Has a thing with Satine gets her killed. Raises a friend and apprentice, sees him turn to the darkside. Kills grevious, people he cares about get killed in order 66. 

So following this storyline he will try to save other jedi but will fail as he failed Anakin.

596,1610590338.0,StarWarsTheories,"Palpatine’s plans in the Rise of Skywalker - Alright so the Rise of Skywalker lays it out pretty clearly: Kylo Ren has been groomed since birth to inherit the legacy of the Sith. With Snoke acting as the Emperor’s proxy, The Sith Eternal and Palpatine were able to watch as Kylo assassinated his Dark Side Master in order to obtain more power, a testament to the Rule of Two. Once Kylo becomes Supreme Leader announces his return, leading Ren to search out Exegol and the reborn Emperor. Palpatine offers Ren command of Final Order, but only if he murders Rey. Rey dies, Kylo gets possessed, Palpatine rules the galaxy within the host body of Emperor Kylo Ren. The End. 

With this in mind, Snoke’s frustration with Kylo Ren in The Last Jedi makes even more sense. Kylo meets with Snoke, with the latter chastising Ren while also showing what appears to be sympathy. He asks Kylo: “How’s your wound?” not because he cares, but because he can’t have Ren damaging the future host body of Snoke’s secret master. 

Once Ren returns to the light side of the Force, Palpatine actually admits that his plan has been disrupted, basically proving that he truly DID plan for Kylo to be his host all along."
597,1610585121.0,StarWarsTheories,"""My allegiance is to the Republic..."" - So I was in the shower going through Episode 3 dialogue and one particular line stood out to me. In the exchange between Anakin and Obi-Wan preceding the Mustafar fight Obi-Wan says this ""Anakin, my allegiance is to the Republic, to democracy."" That line caught me off guard because if, as Mace Windu said, the Jedi were keepers of the peace and not soldiers, why would the Jedi's allegiance be to the Senate/Repiblic? I may not have this all figured out but please try to bear with me. This is all new in my head. 


It was in either in Episode 2 or Episode 3 that Mace Windu tells Yoda that they should inform the Council or Senate that they can no longer use the Force to their maximum ability anymore. Keep that in mind for later on. In Episode 3 there is little talk about some ""outer rim sieges"". Those ""outer rim sieges"" are explored in The final season of Clone Wars, which is about the Seige of Mandalore. This is also when ol' Palps gets ""kidnapped"" by Dooku and Grievous by the way. The Jedi are given a choice, do they go help the Mandalorians who, Obi-Wan had a connection to at one point, or do they ""play politics"", as Ahsoka says, and rescue the Chancellor. That phrase, ""playing politics"" stands out to me. Why would the Jedi be playing politics? They were formed because of their devotion to the Light side of the Force. They are not supposed to be political. 


Now to my MAIN POINT of writing this mess of a theory.


I recently rewatched the Prequels and one thing disturbed me. Obi-Wan said he loved Anakin. Why did he leave Anakin on Mustafar to burn, and quite literally, die. If you truly loved someone and they went down a wrong path, wouldn't you try to save them from that dark path? Put yourself in Obi-Wan's robes for a sec. Lol, lil pun there. You found this kid on a waste land of a planet and your master says he's the chosen one and will do all these crazy things. You end up training the boy, per your master's request and you watch this kid grow up. You love this kid. He ends up falling into the wrong crowd. Wouldn't you want to try to save this kid you grew up with? Also, why was Luke able to sense the good in Anakin but not Obi-Wan? If the Jedi were able to use 100% of their power, like Luke was, they would have been able to sense the conflict in Anakin just as Luke said he could in episode 6. We know that Vader was never truly a devoted Sith. He was always think about Padmé and he even admits it in Return of the Jedi.


TL;DR 
Because the Jedi have strayed from their core ideals (being a religious group of devoted Light Side users), they lose their ability to use the Force. Because of this, Obi-Wan can't see that Anakin is conflicted, thus leaving him on Mustafar to die which allows Palpatine to recover Anakin."
598,1610545172.0,StarWarsTheories,"I've seen this raw strength only once before. It didn't scare me enough then. It does now. - Hello there!

&#x200B;

In the Last Jedi Luke says; *"" I've seen this raw strength only once before. It didn't scare me enough then. It does now."",* when Rey demonstrates her power. It is heavily implied that he is talking about Kylo/Ben,

however it is never explicitly stated.

My theory is that he is actually talking about young Grogu, who he presumably starts training after The Mandalorian season 2.

Grogu is filled with fear and doubt and is shown on multiple occasions using the dark side of the force, really hammering home someone who is more susceptible to the dark side, moreso than Ben Solo and even Anakin Skywalker.

If you want the ultimate bad guy set for the future of the franchise, Grogu is the only one that fits the bill and could eclipse Palpatine both in power and the audiences feeling towards the character. It would at the same time tie the series more together with the movies and maybe explain (Darth) Grogus absence in the latter.

I'm new to the sub, so if this has allready been theorized by someone else, I appologize.

Edit: Someone, Spacecowboy, has commented that Luke does in fact say that it is Ben Solo he is talking about, which pretty much debunks this theory. I misremembered the scene and all clips of the scene cuts out the mention of Ben. 
Anyway, I will still be holding on to the idea of Dark side Grogu. Nothing at this point would be as impactful as that."
599,1610467217.0,StarWarsTheories,"This theory might be a bit controversial but here goes: the sequels and the mandalorian take place in separate universes, both of which are canon - Here me out. Hear me out. This theory revolves on two things, The World Between Worlds and Kylo Ren being Luke’s first student. 

I want to start with the rise of Skywalker. In the beginning of Rise of Skywalker we can see Palpatine creating more Snokes with someone’s blood but they never told who’s, I think this blood is the blood of the one and only Grogu. In episodes of the mandalorian they make it clear they want Grogu’s blood for something and we even get a shot of Snoke. So it seems they want Grogu’s blood for Snoke/ Palpatine. 

In the Rise of Kylo Ren comic #3 we learn that Ben was Luke’s first student but this was contradicted heavily when Luke came to take Grogu as his first student. 

Now onto the part where it’s a separate timeline. Luke coming to save Grogu happened only because of Ahsoka, if Ahsoka never told Mando to go to Tython Luke would never have come and everyone would’ve died. In the world between worlds episode Ezra goes back in time to save Ahsoka from Vader. As soon as Ezra does this, It creates two timelines. One where Ahsoka lives and One where she died. 

In the universe where Ahsoka died, Mando would have never gone to Tython and Luke would never have been reached and he was being tracked by Gideon. Grogu would have been captured by the Dark Troopers, Mando would lead a rescue party for Grogu but they would have died in that room together since the dark troopers were about to kill them and the only people alive would be Grogu and Gideon. In this universe, Grogu is taken by Gideon and is never rescued because the rescue party is dead and they could never reach out to Luke because they never went to Tython. Hence Grogu staying with the empire. Now we know Moff Gideon wants his blood for something and back to the top it seeming like Snoke. And again we see Palpatine using someone’s blood to create more snokes. So it seems this is what the empire was wanting to do with Grogu, to Bring back Palpatine. 

Where as the Timeline Ahsoka lived Grogu is Luke’s first student and not Ben. Palpatine never came back, etc. 

If this isn't true there are way too many plotholes to explain for one show

As for the reason they did this was because they wanted to keep both Fams who hate the sequels happy as well as Fans who like the sequels happy.

If Grogu is 50 year's old and was raised at the Temple, he already had about 20 year's of Training right?

Also he is the same species like yoda so wouldn't he get a special Training? Ahsoka mentioned that he was trained by MANY Masters over the year's, so why many and not by one?

Why do many people think Grogu will join the Dark side as he used the technique (force choke) but never showed any ambitions to be Bad or acting out of his fears.

I think he won't be a Jedi or join the Dark side, maybe we will see a new way of the force and Love will be a big Part of it, using both Sides to fight for the right things. 

What do u think about Grogu beeing a Character acting combining feelings with the force? Having a Codex like he learned from Mando but beeing powerful with both sides of the force? 

Luke said talent is nothing without Training but does he really know what Grogu learned and how he already used the force?

And the last one, why should Kylo kill him? That means Grogu would spend another 20 year's of Training until this happens?"

Okay, so while we were shooting the [bantha crap over on KOTOR fan theories](https://www.reddit.com/r/kotor/comments/f6ez0q/spoiler_kotor_fan_theories/), [u/134340Goat](https://www.reddit.com/u/134340Goat/) mentioned my all time favorite *""Have you been chewing spice?!""* fan theory when it comes to KOTOR: Is Carth Force Sensitive?

So this one starts with a story. I mentioned my brother in law, who is pretty much Keeper of the Jedi Archives. Seriously, he's an English teacher and my sister is a librarian. They met at a sci fi convention and their first date was Phantom Menace. We're taking not just geeks, but geeks who can throw the damn bookshelf at you. Brother in law bought KOTOR on the day it launched and turned it into a week long binge watch at his house. And because brother in law is that kind of geek, he's translating the characters into the West End D6 system. I'm watching him do a playthrough, and he's got Canderous and Zaalbar at Ajunta Pal's tomb.

**Allronix:** Huh. That's odd. Why aren't commenting on anything when Ajunta is speaking?

**Bro in law:** Oh. They can't even see Ajunta. [You have to be Force Sensitive to see a Force Ghost](https://starwars.fandom.com/wiki/Force_ghost)

. The stronger your Sensitivity, the better you can see it.

**Allronix**: Really? Then how come Carth can see it?

**Bro in law** *(gets the ""holy shit, I gotta confirm this"" look):* Really?! He just sees something out the corner of his eye or something?

**Allronix:** No, he sees Ajunta just fine. Understands what the dude's saying too.

Bro in law instantly rolls back to his last save, swaps Zaalbar for Carth, and sees the bit in question.

**Bro in law:** Oh. Dear. *(Goes over to make some quick scribbles on Carth's character sheet)*

Okay, so maybe that was a lore fail. I didn't really think about it too much until I hit that False Level Up glitch and ran around with Carth and Mission as Sentinels. Now, while I couldn't really see Mission as a Sensitive, that little bit with my bro in law nagged at me. And became a ""once you see it you can't unsee it.""[Apologies to TV Tropes, where some of these were my additions to the Wild Mass Guess entry on this topic.](https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WMG/KnightsOfTheOldRepublic)

1. What are the odds of surviving that attack on the Endar Spire, getting to the escape pods, sharing the last escape pod with the mindwiped Sith Lord, piloting through the chaos, landing in what passes for the ""good"" part of town, remaining uninjured, pulling the badly injured mindwiped Sith Lord from the wreck, evading Sith detection while all this is going on, and just happening to find a dump of an apartment where the landlord's not asking questions? That is one amazing string of coincidences and good luck. Get that many in Star Wars, and it's definitely The Force sticking its nose in things.
2. Piloting the escape pod to land in the Upper City, piloting the Hawk through the Sith Blockade of Taris, the random Sith patrols, the escape from the Leviathan, and the fleet around Lehon along with the crash landing that left the ship easily repairable. Now, compare to Atton who we know to be an excellent pilot and drawing on The Force who still manages to crash the ship at least three times.
3. He's a scary good judge of character if you're interacting with other NPCs. If you watch him with other NPC characters, he's got a pretty good compass as to which characters are being helpful and which ones are full of shit. The only one he calls incorrectly is Rukil, who is probably also an untrained Sensitive (the age, the ""marked"" comments) and half senile, which is probably throwing him.
4. Related to that, his distrust and wariness about something not adding up with the PC, the Jedi Council feeding the party a line of bull, that things just aren't adding up. And on all of it? Dead on. He's 100% right about the Player Character, he just expected something a little less crazy than ""that's Darth freaking Revan.""
5. If you play Female Revan, then Carth's the one who gets fried in the torture cages on the Leviathan. Saul comments how strange it is that Carth takes so much punishment and still remains conscious. Now, this is a low level thing, but in lore, Force Sensitives have drawn on it to keep them alive or conscious under duress. Explicitly, the first sign we got that Leia was a Sensitive when she withstood the Imperial torture droid.
6. Another of his scary ass judge of character feats? In the comics, Zayne (who is on the run from the Jedi, who framed him for the murder of his classmates) has a vision that Mandalorians are coming for Serroco. Saul? Laughs it off, throws Zayne in the brig. Zayne's own friends don't even believe him. Carth gets one of those creepy hunches and starts calling in ""duck and cover"" sirens as far as he can broadcast, which sends seventeen cities and millions of people heading for shelter. It saves their lives and Carth is called a hero for it. Armed with another hunch, he disobeys Saul (remember this is before Saul nukes Telos) and lets Zayne ""escape"" from custody. Mind you, not even the Jedi or his party members believed Zayne. Carth did.
7. Carth makes a lot of creepy weird offhand predictions about the future. He says he knows on some level he'll be there when Saul dies. That certainly pans out. He makes an offhand prediction that the Jedi have set the party up to take a fall. Right again. He tells a female PC that she'll have to make a choice soon, one she can't walk away from. And then we get the temple top. He even blurts out that *""I sensed you would have to make a choice soon, and that was* ***it***, *I can feel it*!"" If you specify a LS Female Revan, his recording for T3-M4 says he's had a hunch Revan would leave without warning. Again, spot on.
8. Specify a LS male Revan, and Carth will remark to Bastila that seeing the Exile reminds him ""there are worse things to lose."" The only other people who can see just how screwed up the Exile is are the Jedi Masters, Chodo Habat, and the Force Sensitive party members.
9. Specify a LS female Revan, and Carth will insist that he would know if Revan were dead (again, scary ass intuition) and that there's an ""emptiness"" where she used to be. Now, remember one of the things about a broken Force Bond? It would simply be ""empty, a wound.""
10. You know how your party members in KOTOR 2 feel upset or even horrified as they realize they feel compelled to protect Exile and can't being themselves to leave, even when said actions are kicking puppies? And how they swing wildly from being crazy, almost stalker level possessive of them to being scared out of their wits and clamming up when you try to pry anything out of them? And the more potent (and untapped) their Force Sensitivity, the more they get hammered with the effect? (Mira and Atton in particular) Yeah. Now, Carth's ""I don't wanna talk"" looks a bit different, doesn't it? It could also account for that romance arc, especially if you roll a DSF Revan and go for that ""everyone dies"" ending.
11. Again, Ajunta Pal. Seeing a Force Ghost? Yeah. Some degree of Sensitivity needed. Understanding what he's saying? Yeah. Takes a bit more than that. And Carth makes a weirdly insightful comment about the Dark Side on top of it.
12. Notice that this a wall o text argument already, and I'm now just getting to the ""Yeah, his kid is able to throw around mid-level Dark Side powers and packing a red lightsaber."" Given the jawline and the muleheaded attitude, no way Morgana was fooling around with the pizza delivery boy. That's definitely Carth's kid, and that's definitely Force Sensitivity. Now, while it can skip a generation (see Theron Shan), it tends to run pretty heavy in families.
13. Lastly? Gee. He comes from a planet settled by and heavily populated by descendants of Force Sensitives who failed their training. I'm also willing to bet some bastard children of Jedi get passed off as ""foundlings"" and ""orphans"" and dumped there, too. Jedi are forbidden attachments, but not sworn to celibacy, so...yeah, bastard kids are gonna happen. There's probably a Jedi or two in that family tree. It's circumstantial evidence at best, but it still supports the case.

Now, any arguments I missed? Counterarguments?

And the million credit question: If there's a character who gets to break this news to poor Flyboy, who do you think would actually take that on? How do you think Carth would take that kind of news? And what, if anything, would come of it?

I kinda figure Jolee might be the only one nuts enough to poke that with a stick...I also kinda figure ""Sentinel"" would fit best. Consular? Hell no. He hired Mical for that. Guardian works with the feats, but the whole ""ferreting out deceit and injustice?"" Yeah. That's Carth."
607,1610305143.0,StarWarsTheories,"Theory: Telos was where the Jedi Civil War was lost (crossposted to r/kotor) -  

We all know that Alderaan in the OT was one of those big shatterpoints (pun intended) for the whole Glactic Civil War. And it was one that was the beginning of the end for the Empire. Destroying a Core World known for being a peaceful world of artists and scholars that was loyal on-paper (even if it was an open secret they weren't happy with things) in an unprovoked attack was supposed to cow any world thinking of rebelling into fearful compliance...And instead, a lot of nascent rebel movements went *""Fuck it, we're dead if we do and dead if we don't.""* Planets who had been on the fence or trying to stay out of it went *""We're next, even if we try to placate or negotiate.""* And there was a ton of pissed off Alderaan expats (like Leia and Jan Ors) who were avenging lost loved ones signing up. the Rebellion now had an atrocity to rally around and to tell potential allies ""Look, that could be YOUR planet next.""

With one shot, Tarkin set into motion the end of the Empire. Nice going breaking it. And that brings to mind Telos.

Up until that point, Revan was all surgical strikes and selective targets. Take out one city, spare the rest when the planet surrendered. Assassinate a few key leaders and install quislings. Primarily attack Jedi and the Republic navy, but leave the planetary infrastructure and civilians intact. It was plausible that folks would sign up with Revan or at least be open to the idea because Revan was not the kind of crazy Exar Kun or the Mandalorians ran on.

Telos was a planet that would have been *invaluable* taken ""alive."" The Jedi planned to use it as a hiding spot if they lost Coruscant and/or Dantooine. It's sitting on a major hyperspace route. It has a lot of experienced soldiers, lots of useful hardware and natural resources that could be put to the war effort (yes, the Star Forge is useful. The Forge also had nasty side effects and Revan was smart enough to know that).

And the key resource; a ton of Force Sensitives who would have EVERY reason to turn on the Jedi Order with not much persuasion. Remember, Telos is a world made up of AgriCorps; these were kids who were taken from their families, had all their ties cut aside from The Order is Mother, the Order is Father...and then, come adolescence, they got told *""Meh. You suck. Here's a dead end job on a far away planet.""* It's hard to FIND anything on the Service Corps other than Jedi who call them ""washouts,"" ""failures,"" ""disappointments,"" ""wasted potential."" That's got to leave a lot of hurt and internalized shame. Now add that Jedi are technically barred from having kids, Service Corps are encouraged to pump out kids (ostensibly to settle the worlds they're stationed on), Force Sensitivity having a strong genetic component...Yeah. Let's just add THAT to the fire. Considering that the Service Corps are looked down on by the Jedi as poor relations and treated as breeding stock? It's amazing that more Sith Lords HAVEN'T taken full advantage of this. It's also pretty amazing that the TSF, Carth, and Mical were as civil as they were, given they had every reason in the book to tell a Jedi where to shove the sabers. Taking it would also be a message to the Jedi *""Hey, don't go hiding behind your poor relations. Come out and fight me.""*

So, you're Revan. and you want to see if your apprentice has a marginal clue about how to wage a war, not just fight a battle. You also have this admiral that is defecting, might have some potential as far as overall leadership, and this planet that should be easy pickings. So you go on vacation for a bit and see if Saul and Malak can accomplish this blue milk run. Saul and Malak manage to ***fuck it up*** in such a spectacular way that it defies belief. You get dead rock. No natural resources. No military hardware. No base you can put on the hyperspace route. Now, the Republic has an atrocity to rally around, neutral or friendly planets might be thinking about signing up with the Republic to keep that from happening to them, and the Sensitives who had every reason to resent the Jedi and sign up with you are now going to go to the Republic and the Jedi.

So, after an argument that ends with Malak literally picking his jaw off the floor, you are racing to do damage control on this clusterfuck. You assign Malak to his own flagship and make no secret about shopping for new apprentices because Malak proved he's useless past a battlefield. You assign Saul to Malak because Malak needs some hand-holding in the brains department, and it's as good as sentencing Saul to death because eventually Malak's temper is going to get the better of him.

And the two of them, knowing the ax is coming for their heads, bide their time and wait for their shot...which comes when Bastila boards Revan's ship. Malak orders Saul to fire so he can save his ass by taking out Revan. Saul does so to save his own ass. And things don't work as planned.

And just to cap off the Force's idea of a joke, Revan gets saved again...by a Telosian who was only on that ship to get a shot at Saul for nuking his homeworld."
608,1610304773.0,StarWarsTheories,"What if Revan did not survive? -  

Okay, posting this on KOTOR and SWTOR Reddits pretty much ended in ""Vitiate shows up, everyone dies."" And of course, the only version of Revan considered was the SWTOR version.

But I am pondering this. What if Revan was killed on the bridge of the ship? Bastila gave it the best try but no go. Empty husk. Enough information on the ""hard drive"" to go after the Maps but otherwise dead?

Or maybe go back further and imagine Revan and Mandalore the Indomitable did a mutual kill over Malachor. It ends the Mandalorian Wars, but no Revan past that

Or what if Revan got killed on the Endar Spire? 

I really don't give a shit about Vitiate. He's a badly executed Stu. He can pick one of the nine hells of Corellia and stay there. What I am bouncing off folks here is how would it effect the more immediate situation with the Ebon Hawk crews (both games)."

Between the events after The Mandalorian episode, and before the Rebels epilogue where she gets Sabine to find Ezra, she meets Anakin's force ghost (which we'd most likely see in the series with Hayden and Rosario). Anakin's force ghost helps Ahsoka gain her faith back because, in The Mandalorian, she's kind of faithless because of her previous duel with Vader. She even went to the point of saying that Grogu should wait for his abilities to fade instead of being trained, so that's basically no faith at all. Anakin helps her gain it back, and that's when Ahsoka puts on the white robes because they signify the regaining of her faith in the Jedi and Force, and becomes the Gandalf-esque Ahsoka. That's my main theory. Another small theory that I came up with is, is that Anakin's force ghost refers Ahsoka to Luke Skywalker, so when Sabine goes with Ahsoka, the two are going to go find Luke and get his help in finding Ezra and defeating Thrawn."

I hope I will bring joy to the Star Wars fans with my idea. 
Its about Rey being a Kenobi and not a Palpatine. 

First in Clone Wars, Kenobi and Satir (Kenobis love intres) before episode1. They had spent time together on Mandalore. Where they feel in love with eachother. As you kids know, when two people like Kenobi and Satir loves eachother... Well I can say that Kenobi put his lightsaber in Satir. (better image than Palpatine getting laid). Qui-gon did not know of this.

After Kenobi and Qui-gon is finished with thier mission on Mandalore. They move on to episode1. For the negotination. 

Satir gets pregnant by accident. This child must be keept secret at all cost! For two reasons.
1. Satir is importent on Mandalore, there are people that want to see her dead. 
2. Kenobi is a jedi, and they are not allowed to put thier lightsaber in an other womens. 

As the years go by this child of Satir and Kenobi is living his life hidden amog other ordinary people, he is not force sensitive. He gets a wife and they get a child. Bam! Rey Kenobi is born. 
And her parents later gets killed by the first order. 
Thats why she dosent remember them and dont know who she is. But she is force sensitive as her granddad Obi-Wan.

Grogu as a Mandalorian foundling will complete Mandalorian training as well as Jedi training (he is 'The Mandalorian' in the title).  He avoids Kylo's attack because he is away from the Jedi academy doing Mandalorian training.  He returns soon after and leaves with Luke, who adopts him, to continue his training.  Luke's behavior towards Rey was because he was still trying to protect Grogu, who completes his Jedi training with Ghost Luke after Rise of Skywalker concludes.  The Rise of Skywalker now refers to Grogu Skywalker.

After the events of Rise of Skywalker we find out that true to the emperor's promise his spirit did go into Rey, slowly turning her to the darkside and making her a Sith.  Future trilogy will be Grogu Skywalker vs Darth Rey."

Erza Bridger did just that when he saved Ashoka Tano from Darth Vader's final deathblow when he pulled her into the World Between Worlds. What-if when Ezra Bridger pulled Ashoka Tano he changed history and her fate? If this is true then this could mean we will be getting an alternative epsiode 7, 8, and 9, but they wouldn't be titled by those numbers, instead act as new films with a new timeline. I believe episode 7, 8, ans 9 take place during the timeline when Darth Vader kills Ashoka Tano. However, The Mandalorian takes place during the timeline where Ezra Bridger saved Ashoka Tano from Darth Vader altering time and space. This will also impact Luke Skywalker's future and meeting Grogu was never meant to happen. The only reason Luke Skywalker met with Grogu was due to Ashoka Tano giving Din Djrin information on how to contact a jedi on the planet Tython. If Darth Vader would had killed Ashoka Tano then Din Djarin would had never been able to contact Luke Skywalker which would had led to the events of Episode 7, 8 and the unfortunate Episose 9.

So chirrut has Jedi reflexes but is not force sensitive/low midichlorian count.

627,1609556690.0,StarWarsTheories,"[Mandalorian Theory] Jedi Gideon saved Grogu - Not sure if this has been posted yet or not... and possible spoilers in case this crazy idea actually comes true. #spoiler


What if Gideon was a Jedi and had a feeling what was going to happen with Order 66? He felt, through The Force, what Anakin was about to do and the situation at large just too late to do much about it. The carnage started as he was about to get reinforcements or was able to tell anyone else. Being able to only save and hide with one child, he went for Grogu. Even though Grogu was only an infant, possibly not much more than a newborn, Gideon knew the extreme connection Yoda's species has with The Force. If Anakin were to kill him, it would mean the possible end of a strong bloodline, but if left alive, Palpatine would search for him and possibly have him take Vader's place. A stronger force user may have been a better choice for Palpatine's plans.

In hiding from the clone troopers, Anakin, Palpatine, and everyone else hunting down Jedi, Gideon lost his connection with the light. Being in exile made him do some unspeakable things to survive even going down a dark path. He slowly got to the point where his and Grogu's connection to The Force was minimal. This is why Grogu's memory is so dark, he was forced to turn away from the Force to survive, and Gideon's power blocked his sense.

Gideon was a survivor and knew the empire was the only way to not be killed, and his only way to stop running. He hid Grogu and with his keen knowledge of the Force and some form of sensitivity (secretly) left, he became an invaluable asset to the Empire. Rose through the ranks quickly and lead the siege of Mandalor. 

Now that the Empire is in shambles, Gideon can make a push to fill the void. In Gideon's mind, he now needs Grogu, and his genetic connection to The Force to get back his own connection. He has walked down a dark path,  shunning the Force, and he sees this as his destiny."

There is a discussion of where the sequel trilogy fits in with that and the potential of what fans are calling the ‘Filoni vers’ (an alternate universe/timeline of Star Wars that will be different from the timeline of the sequel trilogy that is run by the dream team of Dave Filoni and Jon Favrou). This is based off of general desire from the fan base, and a small set of inconsistencies some fans have noticed between things that have happened in The Mandalorian when put against the sequels. 

Argument for the existence of the Filoni vers:

1

Small hits that have been made in the first two seasons of The Mandalorian have hinted at this. 
The most significant of which comes from Luke taking Grogu on as an apprentice(208). This is a direct contradiction with the sequels stating that Ben Solo was Luke's first student. Luke started Ben’s training at age 10 which would be in the year 15 ABY, while he is taking Grogu on as a student in 9 ABY. Unless addressed in the coming seasons of The Mandalorian or its sister shows Ahsoka and Rangers of the New Republic, then this is a pretty significant contradiction. 

2

Both Ahsoka and Luke have made some pretty clear jabs at the talent over training mentality that the sequels are attributed to have by most fans.
	“He is strong with the force, but talent without training is nothing”-Luke
	“To wield it[the force] takes a great deal of training and discipline”- Ahsoka

Now if the Filoni vers is to happen, there will have to be an in-univers reason as to why there has been this split. Dave and more over Disney are unlikely to allow the sequels to just, stop being cannon out of nowhere. So in order for it to be an alternate universe rather than an overwrite, there has to be a reason and a difference in the two timelines. Everyone almost universally agrees that this split will have to involve the ‘World Between Worlds’ from rebels(413). This is where my theory comes in.

Ahsoka Timeline Split Theory:
This theory states that the timelines split the moment that Ahsoka is saved from Vader, when Ezra pulls her into the World Between Worlds. This would mean that, from that point forward, there would be a timeline where Ahsoka is dead, and another where Ahsoka is alive. Obviously, seeing as we have seen her in The Mandalorian and will see her in Ahsoka the show, the Filoni vers is the timeline in which she lives. Meaning the Sequel trilogy timeline is the timeline where Ahsoka dies by Vader's hand. Ahsoka dying at that point wouldn't cause any changes for the prequel trilogy or any significant changes in the original trilogy meaning that everything that is currently canon for the sequel trilogy and the beginnings of the Filoni vers can work for both. This could explain several things.

1- Luke Training Grogu

In the sequel timeline, it is likely that Grogu never gets found and trained by Luke. If Ahsoka is dead, Bo Katan never tells Din to her, and she never tells him to go to Tython, which is how Luke finds him. This perfectly arranges for Ben to be his first student, and even assuming that Grogu is around the same way with Din, still isn't in the picture to take Ben's spot as Luke's first student.

2- Ahsoka's Voice (TROS)

In TROS Rey hears the voices of dead Jedi of the past when she is facing down Palpatine. Included in this list of voices is Ahsoka. This led many fans to ask if Ahsoka was, in fact, dead at that point. Disney and Filoni both left it ambiguous as to if she is really dead and if you actually HAVE to be dead to be on that list of voices. Regardless, I feel it makes more sense that she is dead if she is one of the voices. To argue against myself, even if she is dead at the point of TROS, that doesn't mean she died with Vader. But it does work well with that being a touch stone of the fact that she is dead in that timeline. I also found Dave Filonis comments on this question very interesting in reference to this theory.

“It doesn’t really have any big implications to what I’m doing with the character, to be honest,” he said of the moment in the film. “I just thought it was a really fun thing. I thought J.J. [Abrams]’s instinct to be so inclusive with all these various elements of Star Wars and characters [was great]. And I thought it would be a great thing for the actors involved to be a part of something that was just really this celebrating moment of the Star Wars saga. So I didn’t think of it in a literal story [way]. The film, to me, is like a different area.”

“It didn’t really affect what I’m doing especially since I’m before it,” he said. Which could mean, hypothetically, Ahsoka and Sabine’s story during the sequel trilogy, but more than likely means Ahsoka’s story during The Clone Wars. “So when we get to that point [after The Rise of Skywalker] or if we’d ever reach that point again, I don’t know. I’m in this other timeline. I’m in a couple right now. I just honestly love that people ask about the character. To take it from where we did in 2008 to now is pretty exciting.”

In this quote, Dave uses the term ‘other timeline’ to mean what seems like different points in time rather than different timelines, but with the way he talks about it being its own separate thing along with the way he throws around the term could mean that he has had something like this cooking since then.

3- Corrections in the Force

A final, and weak, point is that the sequels involve an idea of the force allowing/creating powerful beings in order to correct itself. With Ahsoka being fairly powerful that would mean there is an even bigger space in the force to fill with either . With the logic of the sequels, the more the power must get spread out, the less powerful it will be, and the less outlets the force has to be channeled through the more powerful the users would be. So in this timeline where there are incredibly powerful and volatile force users, one less powerful force users being around could partially explain why that happened."
631,1609470350.0,StarWarsTheories,"Was Snoke originally intended to be Palpatine? - Many have claimed that Snoke is the spitting image of (a deformed version of) Peter Cushing's Moff Tarkin.  And [this](https://www.inverse.com/entertainment/star-wars-theory-snoke-identity-tarkin) article seems to confirm that inspiration.  But it also states that Peter Cushing's role in the Frankenstein movie was another inspiration.  Why is that relevant?  Take a look at the last picture in the article.  Compare the top of Snoke's head to the rest of his body.  His delicate nose, mouth, and chin do not match the immense cranium.  The distance between his eyes are proportional to his forehead, but not to his chin.  Doesn't it look like the top of a larger man's (very damaged) head, grafted to the jaw and body of a smaller, slightly younger corpse?

I think perhaps JJ always planned to bring back Palps (and why not? What an asset Ian is!). But Palp's resurrection was to begin with his brainpan rubber-cemented to a temp clone. Then Johnson burned it all down by making a nobody out of Snoke.  And then JJ gets his taunting revenge with bacta tanks full of Snokes in ROS.  Personally, I welcome the reconning of the entire new Trilogy to the Toilet Between Toilets.  I feel like we all got caught in the crossfire of a four-year passive-aggressive Postmodern pissing match."
632,1609467409.0,StarWarsTheories,"The new Mortis gods - We’ve probably all seen the drawling of Ahsoka, Starkiller, and anakin/Vader as the mortis gods.  I think this may be brought into canon. Here are my reasons (Sorry for formatting, I’m on mobile)


• both Ahsoka and Starkiller were anakin’s apprentices 


• we know Moria follows Ashoka, but we haven’t seen the son’s manifestation connected with anybody yet


• Starkiller would most likely be an inquisitor, probably called something like the “first son” which fits with the names of the other inquisitors, second sister, fifth brother, etc. 


• SK is tasked with finding Thrawn and his fleet which we’re M.I.A. About a year before ANH, which is why we haven’t seen him yet


• SK and the son are both voiced by Sam Witwer


• Anakin seems not to have visited Luke as a force ghost, because he is on mortis. 


• we don’t see anakin or Ahsoka but we do hear them. I think this is because they have taken their places as the the mortis gods, and we only hear them because of the powerful connection with the light side of the force and Rey defeating Palpatine.


• Dave has gave alluded that Ahsoka is not dead after/during TRoS, this is because she is on mortis, and like the World between Worlds transcends time and space. 


•the old mortis gods were also suspected to be mortal be for becoming the gods )the father a human, the daughter an angel, and the son an umbaran/pau’an?) because of the old republic distress signal

633,1609410669.0,StarWarsTheories,"Sequels of Legends - What if the Sequel Trilogy was set in the Legends universe, about 50 years after the Original Trilogy? That’s ~7 years after the defeat of Abeloth in FotJ, and ~80 before the rise of Darth Kryat in Legacy. What stories or plot lines would you be interested in seeing in such a trilogy? What worlds and characters would you hope to appear?

Personally, I’d like it if the main characters were Darth Vader’s grandchildren and descendants as Jedi knights and padawans—Jaina Solo, Ben Skywalker, and Princess Allana—with the old mainstays like Luke, Leia, and Han as supporting cast.

For the story, I’d hope for a really deep dive into the Force, featuring Whills, Kaiburr Crystals, Midichlorians, all the weird metaphysics of George Lucas’ wildest imagination. A crisis in the Force itself, that only the Skywalkers can rise to face. I’d like to see Luke’s final adventure as a Jedi Master, his own grand finale of the Force, before passing on the legacy of the Jedi to the next generation. I’d also like to see Han win back Leia after a period of separation, for a bittersweet retirement after all they’ve lost. Ben should be a Jedi Knight struggling to live up to his father’s name, Allana a Palawan and a Princess who takes after her late father, and Jaina a jaded bounty hunter-type who inherits the Millennium Falcon—she’s run away from her role as a Jedi Knight, and as a Galactic Empress, to become the scoundrel she’s always been, deep down. Her and Ben would act as foils, debating the nature of the Force and the Jedi Code, with Princess Allana between them. But they all have to come together to address this grand dilemma—perhaps a Force plague of some kind, or the return of the ancient Architects of the galaxy.

I would also like the story to address slavery, perhaps through the liberation of either droids or clones, in thematic culmination of Vader’s origins and arc. I’d like to see a Yuuzhan Vong protagonist, maybe even as a Force sensitive. Cameo wishlist: I’d like to see the return of Ahsoka Tano (Episode VII), Mace Windu or an evil clone (Episode VIII), and cyborg Maul (Episode IX). If Palpatine were to return as the final big bad, I’d like to see Vader return too, as Force ghosts to face each other one last time. I’d really like to see the Jedi Order and the New Republic/Galactic Alliance learn from their mistakes, and reform into less centralized powers—I’d especially like to see the New Jedi Order decoupled from any individual government, and instead serve the galaxy as a whole. These long term changes in galactic politics should be Grand Master Luke and Chief of State Leia’s most lasting victories, greater than anything they ever accomplished on the battlefield or with a lightsaber in hand.

As for planets, I think it’d be cool to visit the shards of Alderaan, featuring that asteroid field as the set of some key scene or battle. Tatooine may appear one last time, having become a religious hermitage for those who worship the bloodline of the Chosen One—the Skywalkers. The Hutts would love this, turning holy profits on pilgrimage. I’d rather return to Kashyyyk, though, to visit the Wookiees. I’d also love to see Ruusan, Korriban, Mon Cala, Ossus, and/or the Kessel Maw. The Deep Core and the Unknown Regions—surely some worlds we’ve never visited before. This is Star Wars, after all.

Those are just some semi-random ideas of mine, though. I really want to know what you folks would like to see in a trilogy like this—the VII, VIII & IX of an alternate universe that followed from Legends rather than from Disney, set 50 years or more after the Original Trilogy. And what should their titles be? The only one I’ve come up with that sounds any good so far is “Star Wars: Episode IX: Twilight of the Jedi.” But I really want to know what y’all think!

TLDR: What if the Sequel Trilogy took place in the Legends EU, ~50 years after New Hope? What stories, worlds, and characters would you want to see?"

Working off of SW Legends.

In training Sidious, Plageuis describes a Sith as not simply calling the Force to aid onesself, but to have mastery of it and for it to be part of you.

He also describes the Rule of 2 as ""The master, to embody the power, and the apprentice, to envy it"".

Sidious is constantly focused on having his apprentice kill him. Not on having and maintaining his power, but simply gaining it, and finding the perfect apprentice to replace him.

For Kylo, look at his relationship with Snoke. He doesn't seem to truly envy the power, only to do Snoke's will. Never considering taking it for himself, only about facilitating his own power.

You may be wondering why I omitted Vader. Because Anakin was the Chosen One, he has a much stronger connection to the Force. Because of this, he easily flows into the Dark Side after his fall. Therefore, he is more naturally wielding the Force rather than the other two attempting to subjugate it."

In Rebels we see that Ezra Bridger went to the world between worlds and saved Ahsoka from being killed by Darth Vader. With Ahsoka being alive now she tells Din Djarin about the Seeing Stone. Without that knowledge Din Djarin and Grogu would probably never meet Luke Skywalker and Luke would never have trained Grogu.

639,1609222909.0,StarWarsTheories,"R2D2 'sleeping' is tied to Star Wars rebranding of ""Legends"". - So ive thought this for awhile but havent ever seen anyone else say it so sorry if its already been said;

Every Star Wars story prior to Disney was the Expanded Universe that they now tell us is ""Legends"". Disney decided that the movies are not legends, as well as The Clone Wars 2008 (but not 2003's).
Long story short, looking at what theyve done with 'canon', it seems that 'Legends' are just that - ""legends""/stories/tales that were just stories. 

Now its been long theorized/[confirmed](https://dorksideoftheforce.com/2016/04/25/george-lucas-r2-d2-is-the-narrator-of-star-wars/)(idk, edit:ok i googled it) that George Lucas intended his movies to be actually R2D2 recounting the story. 

So what does 'Legends' being star wars folklore have to do with this? 

R2-D2 was powered down for years in the sequels and its explained as:

>According to the novelization, which is canon, R2 was in low power mode because his software could not handle the sheer amount of info within the imperial database. He needed to be in low power mode to focus entirely on the information that pertained to Luke's location specifically.

***TLDR;*** Sounds to me like R2D2 had to deal with purging an overload of EU stories while he was asleep and needed to purge all those 'stories' before he could get back to the 'canon' story. The Legends were basically incomplete, incorrect, or corrupt data within R2."
640,1609208897.0,StarWarsTheories,"[A New Hope/Obi Wan] The circle is now complete... - **Background**

A lot has been written with regards to Hayden Christensens return for the Obi Wan Kenobi series and this particular quote:

""The circle is now complete. When I left you I was but a learner, Now I am the master""

From this you can assume that the last time they met was that fateful duel on Mustafar. What I suggest is that maybe we misinterpret this, and that their may in fact be a meeting or meetings that do not discredit this statement.

**Jedi Master Anakin Skywalker**

When we catch up with Anakin and Obi Wan in Revenge Of The Sith, Anakin believes himself ready to be a master on the Jedi Council. We know in his characterisation that he has self confidence, arrogance. Ultimately he is turned down by the council, not because of his skill level but because of the anger they sense in him. Even Obi Wan believes Anakin to be ready to become a master. As we all know, ultimately Anakin is placed on the Council due to influence from Palpatine and a need for the Jedi to spy on the Chancellor.

But the important thing to take from this, is that although not given the title, Anakin was at the required level. He did not lose his battle with Obi Wan Kenobi because he was less skilled or less powerful in the force and in fact if you go back to that duel, Anakin recovers quicker from the deflected force push and looks a lot fresher towards the final moments of the fight than Obi Wan. It was arrogance that ultimately failed Anakin.

**The fall of Obi Wan Kenobi**

I suggest that Obi Wan Kenobi will struggle with PTSD. He has seen almost the entirety of the Jedi Order purged, lost his master to the Sith back in The Phantom Menace and failed his ""Brother"" in his own words.

Whilst on Tattooine, Obi Wan will commune through the force with Yoda, learning the techniques needed to become one with the Force, seek guidance from Qui Gon and when the time comes, transcend into a spirit of the Force.

Obviously there will be a lot more meat and potatoes to this series but I do feel this will be a key plot point. Obi Wan will not be able to reach Qui Gon and instead his communications will be with Anakin. Knowing of his failure Obi Wan falls slowly towards the dark side and decides he must finish the job he started. At some point in the series Obi Wan will give into anger hate and suffering, seek out Darth Vader and defeat him BUT cannot deliver a final blow for all the intent he has.

Obi Wan at that moment was stronger than Vader who was still learning how to fully utilise his power from within the confines of his life support.

**He died around the same time as your father**

And with that, the Obi Wan we knew from the prequel trilogy was dead, his new mantle the crazy wizard Old Ben. Anything left of the good in Anakin completely erased by the anger of Obi Wan. It takes the emergence of the twins in the cycle of the Force to snap Obi Wan back to his senses and finally bring Anakin back from the brink."
641,1609203173.0,StarWarsTheories,"Grogu and the Sequel Trilogy - To start off, I do not like the Sequel Trilogy, but I love the mandalorian and I love Star Wars. 


Facts:

-Dr. Pershing is from the cloners on Kamino (if not Kamino at least the same cloning group that made the clones from Jango Fett)

Theory
My theory is that Moff Gideon wants Grogu’s blood to work on Palpatine’s clones project. If that is the case, then Grogu’s blood will be used to create clones (like Rey’s father). 
Now obviously Grogu is strong with the force and his blood would carry the Midiclorians. (I think).

For me I liked 99.9% of this movie but would like there to be one change....the crawl. I don’t get why the reveal of Palpatine occurs in the crawl.

It was bad enough for it to be revealed in the trailer before going into the movie but it’s a worse way to reveal the return of Palpatine for those now experiencing the sequel trilogy for the first time. Without the benefit of the trailer and lead up to the movies release.

My daughter was only a few years old when the trailer came out she is just starting to watch some of the movies and getting to know the characters and will watch the sequels trilogy in a few years. For her this going to be a real let down to read that he’s back in crawl. The reveal of Palpatine for her could be better.

I propose we lobby Lucasfilm to change the opening crawl to this movie so future viewers can experience the reveal in a better way.

To me this is a reasonable requests. It’s not asking for reshoots , new scenes or anything like that it’s just an edit of the crawl so the movie is setup a bit better for future viewers. What do you think?

If you look at Maul’s desire for Kenobi in TCW season 4/5 and season 7, you will see a big difference. In Seasons 4/5 maul is obsessed with getting revenge and is doing everything he can to do so. In season 7 he is pretty chill and wants Kenobi and Skywalker so he can sabotage Sidious’ plan. But in Rebels he has lost crimson dawn and is back to the stage where he is doing everything he can to get revenge on Kenobi. 

My theory is Kenobi destroyed Crimson dawn making Maul want it get revenge and bringing maul to the state he is in, in Rebels 

That’s what I think tell me what you think guys

Edit: i don't think i was clear on this, but many of you are saying Maul was surprised that Kenobi was alive, my theory is that Kenobi destroys Crimson Dawn, but Maul doesn't know that.

646,1609167829.0,StarWarsTheories,"Rey’s relation to the Skywalkers - Hi all,
First post here and not sure if this has been posted anywhere before but I just thought I would share my thoughts on this. 

So I believe Rey is related to the Skywalkers (Luke & Leia being her first cousins: Kylo being her second cousin). My theory behind this comes from how Anakin came to be (Palpatine manipulating midi-clorians to create him in Shmi’s womb). As we discovered in the final installment, Rey is Palpatine’s granddaughter, meaning Anakin had a half sibling down the line as Palpatine was trying to secure his lineage. 

It would explain not only the deep connection between Kylo & Rey and how they are able to connect with with the force the way they do. This would also explain how Rey & Leia feel a strong connection and why Leia took her underneath her wing. Leia always had the force and why she was able to accept her and Luke were siblings, she just knew. 

While Rey’s storyline made many upset (how she had no connection to anyone, etc.) and how she changed her name to Skywalker, I kind of don’t blame her. She has some claim to it since she is related to them and at the end of the day, they’re all really just the Palpatine family. The only reason the Skywalker name is so coveted are because of Luke and Anakin, and the name actually just comes from Shmi.

As a disclaimer, this is strictly a theory. I haven’t watched a lot of additional shows, movies within the franchise, so this is information I theorized over rewatching the 9 movies. I don’t claim to know everything about Star Wars, I just thought it was an interesting way of looking of how the characters all really tie in together."

656,1608950249.0,StarWarsTheories,"The possibility of Mando becoming a mandolorian-jedi! SPOLIERS FOR CHAPTER 13! *OUTDATED* - #  WARNING: THIS IS MY FIRST POST DON'T BE ANGRY

&#x200B;

**Mandolorian-Jedi - Mando Chapter 13?**

Can we for a few minutes/seconds take a look and possibly entertain the very idea that Mando could possibly be somewhere in the future a mandolorian-jedi!?

Obviously with the appearance of Ahsoka Tano, there will be speculations of many things: a unlikely yet brilliant teamwork and team-up of mando and her. Grogu, Ahsoka and Mando all in one untimely trio. Not only would it be pleasing and intriguing to see him become one, it would lead the storyline down and interesting path. Perhaps he could revive the Jedi council and do a lot more for the force and the entire Jedi council.

**In chapter 12:** Mando helps the independent settlement (Carasynthia Dune among others) with taking down the Imperial Remnant base for the information which does indeed include some cute scenes with Grogu and the blue macarons/macaroons. However it also shows that despite what they thought Moff Gideon is still alive and well and I think the appearance of it suggests that he could make a bigger return in the future of the series. Tarre Vizsla was the first Mandolorian-Jedi and he created the Darksaber, perhaps a return of it with Moff Gideon is in the near future, this also again could reference that Mando could get the darksaber in an epic fight with Moff Gideon and it could lead him to a strong connection with the force, also when him and Ahsoka visit the temple soon perhaps he could be drawn to the Force then.

**In chapter 13:** when Grogu's name is learnt, it is a wholesome and heart-warming moment when, who can only be considered a father figure to Grogu, Mando uses his name and draws his attention to him. The again wholesome moment where Mando is the only person that can make Grogu use his force and come out of hiding because of the strong emotional connection he has with our favourite Mandalorian. When Ahsoka asks Mando if Grogu has displayed any connection with the force before and he says Grogu has powers and done things he cant explain, he almost seems in awe and intrigued at what this ""force"" is and almost seems as though he wants to learn more about it. And again this is present when you see his reaction to Grogu using the force to get the ball from Mando's hands. It is a coming of the age-moment and is a very important event for the entire series.

**Conclusion:** All I'm saying is that we should at least consider the very idea, even if it doesn't happen it's still fun to imagine and entertain."
657,1608833764.0,StarWarsTheories,"Could Darth Momin and the Grand Inquisitor still be around in the current era in some form or another? - So as far as I know Momin's mask is still around and posses's some conection to the dark side also the last time I checked Darth Vader had cursed the Grand Inquisitor to eternally guard an outpost. Now I've come across two characters in Star Wars Dark Legends, both sound strikingly similar to Momin and the Grand Inquisitor.

One story was about a mask that was cursed which reminds me of Darth Momin and the other involved a phantom that snatched children (who I suspect were force sensitive) from an orphanage. I think after the Empire fell or close to it's fall these stories in Dark Legends occurred or at least in areas still in Empire controlled space. Anyway my main theory is they are both still around in some form one trying return to the physical world and the other trying to find a new permanent body.

I mean it makes sense when Vader died his stuff including Momin's mask would have been looted I imagine and with his death I can see the Grand Inquisitor gaining a great deal more freedom. I think this would be a good avenue to explore especially with Sidious gone for good. I can see Momin reaching out to the Inquisitor in some supernatural mystic way and for them to form an alliance becoming a new power house."

We already know that he's a clone so he could be the why the remnants of the empire want a strong force sensitive. It might have been part of palpatines order for the re berth of the empire. I think this could be very likely but still they would need gogru blood and he is with Luke now so I doubt he will be in danger and there is a chance they took his blood while Mando looked for him but the scientist was on his way so I doubt it but hey anything could happen.
659,1608801044.0,StarWarsTheories,"Theory: How high is Grogu’s midichlorian count? Is it the highest ever? - I’m not sure if this has been discussed, but how high could Grogu’s midi count be? From simple google searches you can find that Yoda’s midi count was 18,000 per cell, Obi-wan’s was 15,000, Palpatine’s is said to be higher that Yoda’s around 18,500-19,000, and the highest known was Anakin Skywalker’s at 20,000 midis per cell. 

Going off some other fan theories, the blood being taken from Grogu that is being used in the cloning experiments is eventually the research that brings the Emperor back into action. 

That being said and if that theory is true, then Grogu’s midi count has to be higher than Anakin Skywalker. 

Why? I believe the Emperor already had ample amounts of Anakin Skywalker blood due to the fact that he manipulated midis to create Anakin in the first place, and also had opportunity when he reconstructed his body after his defeat by Obi-wan on Mustafar. 

Many things could have happened along the way. This is Star Wars of course. Blood samples could have been destroyed, lost, or possibly never even possessed. Who knows. But I’m beginning to believe that Grogu may be one of the strongest midi counts the galaxy has ever seen.

662,1608759337.0,StarWarsTheories,"Did the Bad Batch rescue Grogu from the Jedi Temple during Order 66 - I've given a lot of thought as to who saved Baby Grogu from the Jedi Temple during order 66 and always assumed it'd be a Jedi. After seeing the post that R2D2 might have rescued him, it had me thinking of other possibilities. 

 Let me start by saying I don't believe for a moment that the Grogu storyline ends at the end of season 2 of the Mandolorian. I don't see how he would come back in the show and then realized that there are roughly 3000 new Star Wars TV shows coming out on Disney+ over the next few years. With Dave Filoni helming these shows I'd like to think that the majority of them with have a  Grogu story thread throughout these series to show where he ends up in the end. 

 With that thought, I wondered what series coming out takes place during ordder 66. That's when I remembered The Bad Batch series.. In the trailer we see several different clue to my theory. 

1) there are scenes where it looks like they're fighting other clone troopers

2) during the holo-message of Palpatine declaring a galactic empire, it looks like they're on Coruscant. 

So my theory is:

 The Bad Batch are on Coruscant when order 66 is launched, because they are defective clones, their chips don't register the order. Being that they are still loyal to the Jedi, the immediately go to the temple to help them out. Because they're Clone Troopers, they'd have access to the temple with no question from the Palpatine controlled clone troopers and they decide to rescue as many younglings as they can. Which includes, The Wee Baby Grogu. I don't think the whole series will be about Grogu, but just 2 episodes of them rescuing him along with other younglings and what they do with them before moving on.

 I love the idea of the coming shows sprinkling in the history of Grogu slowing coming to age and how his life experiences turn him into a perfectly force balanced master who in doing so, brings a true balance to the force, no Skywalker ever did. It's been said, the Grogu and Anakin were born around the same time, so it's possible that Grogu is the true chosen on and with his interactions with the Mandolorians, Luke, Asoka and so much more, he'll embody a true understanding of the the force the connects the universe and become balanced force user.

665,1608712888.0,StarWarsTheories,"Guys, i think i cracked the storm trooper code!! - I think i found out the reasons that stormtroopers A) have crappy armor B) have bad aim.

A) they have crappy armor that is barely good enough to make them not die instantly by blasters but rather they get incapacitated by getting shot, Meaning that after a battle they can get reycled back into the empires seemingly limitless army of stormtroopers. The empire makes the armor bad because they need to keep it cheap to mass produce because once a soldier is doctored up and ready to battle again, they get a brand new set of armor.

B)  they have bad aim because they are so concused and have so much brain damage from prior battles that left them incapacitated, that they can barely aim well because they are too busy seeing double to get a clear shot. Either that or the empire also mass produces cheap blasters as well as armor to reduce the cost of equiping their army.

This is my first post here on this subreddit so if i did something wrong or if you have somthing to add to it, please comment down below. 

TL, DR: 
a) bad armor = cheap to make.

667,1608690722.0,StarWarsTheories,"Din Djarin Will be a Mandalore Jedi Knight Theory -  

Close to the ending of Season 2 the last part we see Din Djarin defeating Moff Gideon who had officially claimed the Dark Saber now belongs to Din Djarin being the rightful heir to it while he stated it infront of Bo Katan and after she saw Din with the Dark Saber in his hand only made her express her concerns and inner anger. She wanted to be the mandalore and have the Dark Saber instead of Din. But here's the catch the Dark Saber dosen't belong to Darth Maul nor the ones who had defeated him as well the Story of someone defeating someone else with the Dark Saber is a disgraceful made up rule that makes zero sense

The Dark Saber was stolen thus it is not yours to have, It was stored inside the Jedi Temple after Tarre Vizslar passing the inventor of the Dark Saber and the first Jedi Mandalorian Knight who was born in Mandalore but I have to remind you that Mandalore was only a settlement name given to the planet Roon.

The true and earliest ones were born in coruscant who later on moved to planet roon before naming it after the First Mandalorian aka Mando'a, which makes the fact that being true heritage of mandalorian logically is irrelevant of being born in Mandalore, As the Taungs where not born there but only chose to settle there and name it mandalore after conquering the planet as their new home.

Din Djarin suffered similar fate he was forced out of his home planet from a invasion just like taungs being forced out of coruscant by batallions of zhell who forced them to flee and move to another planet, This feels very symbolic to me.. Something special about Din.

He Has a strong connection to Grogu from a kind with high level of Midichloria

He has a Unknown parents and there's no info of except the name of the place he is from which seems to be the settlement instead of the planet

He is in dark bland red robe as well His parents, Like Force Cultists such as disciple of whills. it could mean Din Djarin was a part of the cult and was a gifted with the force not told by his parents as they had recently discovered and would bring Din to the Whills before the invasion.

He dosen't know what a Jedi is, But still knows the quote '' may the force be with you '' even says it potentionally related to the force cult since it would Make sense

If we look at what armorer says to Mando

'' You are a clan of two ''

'' Child of the Watch ''

Dosen't this seem a bit iffy? How Din Djarin was saved by the Death Watch clan but later on was raised up in Nevarro which has not been stated but rather assumed by lots of people, The truth is The Children of the Watch sure sounds similar as if they didn't include death with Intention.

Could it be that Din Djarin was not only saved and Raised by the Death Watch clan but also was Raised by the members of house viszla? They even have their viszla mark on their shoulder.

This could be a huge possibility where Din Djarin became a adoptive son to the family of Viszlar afterall Not only is he a part of the Watch but so is Paz Vizslar who shares the same aftername as Vizsla which could mean they had a son or brother that was never mentioned, Perhaps due to the fact House of Vizslars later created more clans which brought a conflict between them including the Vizslars diminishing their cultural Idea of being a mandalorian by setting their own ideals and rules to how to be an mandalorian we have seen many of the clans has been desperate to become the new mandalore.

It leads to Din Djarin being Tarre Vizslar's reincarnation, Just think of it Din Djarin is dedicated and loyal to the rightous act of a leader and a mandalorian as well Jedi He does not seek to conquer nor change it he only follows tradition of the watch that simply could be another Clan that was created by Deathwatch who were members of House Vizla. Maybe they came to an disagreement which seperated them due to cultural differences through renewal and changes that the Watch did not remain fond of thus adopting the name Children of the Watch who were true to the Mandalorian Tradition when necessary, that had followed Tarre's culture which took settlement in Nevarro after the Great Purge. armorer knows about it as much as Din suspiciously.

During the Droid Seperatist invasion by the Army a bit before Mauls fight with Pre Viszlar, Din Djarin was specifically saved by The Death Watch Vizla Clan eventually being raised up by the Viszla relatives in House Vizla, Was this maybe intended Din Djarin was already a force sensitive yet how could they know Din Djarin was hidden inside the small trash compactor after there was a blast that hit his parents after they shut the door infront of Din it would be unclear wether if he was in there or even alive highly unlikely but they went to check no matter what.

Could it be maybe that Din Djarin is force sensitive anf thats why they specifically saved him he was supposedly the Adoptive Child a symbolic reincarnation of Tarre Vizla force sensitive that is meant to become Mandalore, Dar'Jetii No longer a Jedi hinting to him being a force sensitive midichlorian? So the great purge started and Mando was still very young not prepared to take the mantle of mandalore neither was he trained enough to be one for being too young as well Order 66 may have made it Impossible for Din Djarin to become a Jedi when armorer and the others had no Idea how to train force sensitive beings Usually mandalorians despised the Jedis but once had a Jedi Mandalore.

It as well could be too dangerous for Din to become a Jedi or even be told to everyone that he is force sensitive during the Droid invasion and Great purge interfering that Idea since almost all Jedis would be slayed as well Mandalorian having to rely instead on Making Din Djarin fully Mandalorian trained for survival instead of learning his force abilities that he has yet to even know hence why he dosen't know anything about the Jedi's nor how the force works because armorer has kept it secret while Paz Viszla is unaware or probably is doing the same.

They probably want to keep it a secret till he's ready to know, Which is why Armorer is so bent on Din Djarin's fate being it he needs to decide his own path through the ways of Mandalore but also their passion of the craft just like Tarre Vizslar who were positive to become an ally with the Jedi by becoming one.

Their holy sayings are '' The way of Mandalore '' and not Way of Mandalorian, simply potentional leaders like Paz Viszla and Din Djarin sharing adoptive heritage.

There's many hints to Din Djarin being truly a spiritual force heir of Mandalore.

Such as when they call Him Mando, The taung uses Mando a slang for many common terms such as Sole ruler, Daughter and Son and so on afterall Mando'a is Ancient Taung language later on Utilized by the Humans.

He has lots of D in his names like Din and Djar similarly to the tongue of Taung who also uses those pronous as Dar'Jetii means no Jedi theres a suspicion that Din Djarin is no Jedi yet a foreshadow to his future.

So I would say Din Djarin is destined and fated to become the True Mandalore who follows Tarre Viszlas Vision and thats to reunite all the clans and mandalorians out there in the galaxy with good intention to rejoin the fallen Mandalore that Din will rebuild without having doubts with them.

You saw how quickly Din Djarin identified Boba Fett as a Mandalorian when Boba proved to him his Father was Mandalorian who fought during the Great Civil War helping the mandalorians win the war which made him a true mandalorian, Bo Katan would unsee this and become denial of his mandalorian heritage the difference is, Mando is much more likely to make allies he is simply the one mandalorian with a gifted instinct he has honor and gives people a chance to redeem or prove themselves, what a true jedi and mandalore would do.

Which is why Pre Viszla isn't the rightful heir of the Sword either since Breaking the Jedi way and Mandalorian way would not give you the right to wield or even own the Dark Saber, we all have to remember Pre Viszla made up the rule that as long you defeat the Wielder of Darksaber it is yours to hold, But he never defeated Tarre, And he ordered the Clan of Viszla to put the Jedi Temple in ruins and take the Dark Saber which is something Tarre Viszla would not approve of since he is a Jedi and a Mandalorian.

Dark saber isn't a necessity for survival it is only a symbol of The first mandalorian to Join the Jedi Order and make both allies.

Pre Viszla broke that code thus he is in no position to claim it.

In order to truly own the saber and approved by Viszla I believe he would approve only of someone that Is dedicated to both.

Din Djarin, He has the darksaber and the beskar spear but not fully the owner of it yes In the eyes of Mandalorian Bo Katan and ISB Agent Moff Gideon.

But in the eyes of Tarre Viszla, I think thats where the journey goes, Din will not feel the sense of owning the dark saber and being the mandalore since he first needs to realize his potentional which he hasn't yet."
668,1608684697.0,StarWarsTheories,"Theory of the ownership of the Darksaber - Ok so obviously spoilers for Episode 16 of Mandalorian. So as we all know, Mando wins a battle against Moff Gideon, rightfully claiming the Darksaber. And as its revealed, Gideons plan was either he wins and kills mando, or he loses and the Darksaber now belongs to Din Djarin, and now must be won in combat by Bo-Katan. She says that the Darksaber ust be won in combat, something that has only appeared so far. I think I can agree with a quite a few of SW fans who think this is kinda dumb, but if this is how it’s gonna work from now on, its extremely easy to point out a little bit of a mistake that was made. A lot of you tubers are making loads of videos saying how the Darksaber was never given to Bo-Katan either, so it never really belonged to her anyways, but thats really the tip of the iceberg. From my mind, I would say that Pre Visla had the rightful claim to the Darksaber, and then Maul claimed it. After maul takes the throne to Mandalore, Emperor Palpatine beats both Maul and Savage in fair duel, then technically calming the Darksaber. No one actually continues to beat Emperor Palpatine in combat, meaning that from that point on he is the owner of it. Regardless of the fact that other people take it, they never truly own it. The dumbest part is, presumably, Bo-Katan already knew this. So from now on it gets a little bit confusing. In Revenge of the Sith, Palpatine goes into combat with the Jedi that come to assassinate him. He kills the first wave, but ultimately loses in lightsaber combat to Mace Windu. Either Mace Windu techinically claims ownership of the Darksaber, and then gets beaten by Palpatine, claiming ownership once again, or the simpler version, Palpatine ultimately wins the battle and doesn’t lose ownership. Again, it becomes slightly more complicated, as he goes into a duel with Yoda. This battle doesn’t have the clearest winner, but in the end it should be seen that he wins the duel, keeping the Darksaber, but the argument could also be made that Yoda (somehow) could’ve won the duel, and won the Darksaber as well. To this I say that Yoda would eventually die, and the owner of the Darksaber would revert to the one living owner of it, making sidious the owner once again. Then after sitting on a chair for all of the OT, Palpatine then goes back into the danger zone when Luke comes into play. In the climax of Return of the Jedi, Palpatine attacks Luke with force lightening, and then gets thrown in the ventilator shaft by Vader. This could be seen as one of two ways. Either Palpatine dies in his first form, and the ownership of the Darksaber goes to Vader who then dies, or Palpatine never actually died at all and continues to be the owner of the Darksaber until he gets beat by Rey. 

So at the end of this so horribly hard to read theory, the owner ship of the Darksaber inevitably goes as so;
Pre Visla, Maul, Sheev Palpatine, Darth Vader, and then it stops.
Or
Pre Visla, Maul, Sheev Palpatine, Mace Windu, Sheev Palpatine, Yoda, Sheev Palpatine, Darth Vader, then it stops.
Or 
Pre Visla, Maul, Sheev Palpatine, Rey Palpatine, then it ends. 

There’s the theory. Half baked, horribly written, and probably wrong. Enjoy!"
669,1608668744.0,StarWarsTheories,"Its pretty f*cked up that sending Anakin to war could have prevented/delayed him turning to the dark side. - I was recently thinking about the scene in Revenge of the Sith where the Jedi Council is meeting and they discuss the mission to Utapau to capture or defeat General Greivous. Anakin informs the council that Palpatines people have located Greivous on Utapau, and informs them as well that Palpatine requested Anakin be the one that goes to face him. Windu, present on Coruscant, denies the request, Yoda (on Kashyyyk) suggests a Master be sent, and Ki-Adi Mundi (on Mygeeto) suggests Obi-Wan be the one that goes. The other Jedi agree, and its decided.

Palpatine has his hand in this situation in one particular way: he can make sure that Anakin is not the Jedi that is sent, meaning that he can ensure Anakin stays near him, on Coruscant. He does this by requesting that Anakin be sent. He knows that if HE suggests it, then Anakin is the one Jedi the Council will not even consider. I often see people discussing how Palpatine had Obi-Wan sent to Utapau, but I do not totally agree with this. Ki-Adi Mundi, who isn't even on Coruscant, is the Jedi that suggests Obi-Wan. I DO believe that Palpatine had his fingers crossed that Obi-Wan would be sent, and probably assumed that he is who they would pick given Kenobis experience with Greivous. But I standby that he couldn't guarantee this would happen, or directly control it himself.

The point though is that I see a lot of people who say that Obi-Wan being away from Anakin during his crucial moment is a huge reason that Anakin turned, and I agree. Obi-Wan always helped pull Anakin towards the light whenever he drifted, whenever he was there for it anyways. Its also worth noting that Anakins darkest moments happen when hes separated from Obi-Wan, such as his mothers death in Attack of the Clones, and his confrontation with Mace and Sidious.

Whats super messed up though is, keeping all of this in mind, that the very best thing for Anakin at this point in his life? Like the best thing for himself, personally? It would be to just get the hell away from Coruscant. If he WAS the Jedi who was picked to chase Greivous, he probably would have been fine. At least for a little while longer. Like how fucking sad is it that in Anakins life at this time, the best thing for him is to get sent off to war?

Just had me thinking. Anakin really was in a rough spot."

675,1608596090.0,StarWarsTheories,"Mandalorian Season 3/Book of Boba Fett Season 1 Storyline Theory - Din Djarin is likely a member of the what is left of the Mandalorian branch known as Death Watch (now under the name The Tribe, the group that split from the Mandalorian society the Nite Owls established under Bo Katan when she wielded the dark saber and was the rightful ruler of Mandalore (despite not winning the saber in combat she received the blessings of the Mandalorians to claim the saber and the mantle that comes with it legitimately despite the lack of a trial by combat)), which was once under the command of Pre Vizsla in 21 BBY who also wielded the dark saber and led House Vizla during the Clone Wars. 

Tare Vizsla was the first Mandalorian to ever be brought into the Jedi Order as well as the creator of the dark saber. Through the creation of the dark saber, the mantle of leadership for the Mandalorians was no longer passed down through the helmet of Mandalore the First, the leader of the Taung warriors species who were the original Mandalorians. While the helmet was no longer needed to symbolize leadership, Tare Vizsla did adopt, along with other things from the early days of Mandalore, the symbol of the first Mandalorians, the Mythosaur skull. These beats were indigenous to the planet of Mandalore which also held the metal of Beskar which would be used to create the Mandalorian armour we still see used by Din and Boba (as well as all other kinds of Mandos no need to list all). Mandalore the First claimed the skull of the Mythosaur to be the symbol of Mandalore once the beast had been rid of the Taungs' new home planet. This symbol was used by Tare Vizsla, as well as Pre Vizsla and is the same enormous metal skull above the forge where Din's Beskar armour is masterfully crafted as we see it stand against Ahsoka's lightsabers, repeated direct hits from a Dark Trooper(which would have been able to break down the door on Gideon's ship which was weaker metal but many times thicker), and repeated close-range blaster shots from Gideon also in Chapter 16. Almost as if crafted by someone who learned from those who respected the ancient ways of the last true, fully respected leader of the Mandalorians before the constant infighting and civil war began, Tare Vizsla the founder of the House of Vizsla. The same person who dons her sanctum, which we see her dutifully protect with her life, with an enormous, beautiful Mythosaur skull. 

But by Din taking the Mudhorn signet, this is a symbolic breaking from the House of Vizsla and the ancient ways of Mandalore, and because Din won the Darksaber in combat from Moth Gideon in Chapter 16 he is now the rightful leader of Mandalore and is in a position to reform the Mandalorians as he sees fit. 

The only issue is Din does not seem to care about any of that or have any interest in the dark saber or that power and mantle that comes along with it. This is why season three of Mandalorian will be running alongside the Book of Boba Fett because as Boba, the man Din aided in a mission to reclaim Boba's own Beskar armour, which as Din himself knowns in nothing at all to sneeze at (plus Boba has that sweet, sweet rocket), claims the throne of the criminal underworld by sitting where Jabba the Hutt once did and will, over the course of his own show, actively become the respected ruler, most definitely through bloodshed. Din will feel a responsibility to stop Boba from becoming too powerful and potentially aiding the rise of the Empire, who thanks to Moth Gideon, Din sees as a threat to Grogu's safety. But with Grogu no longer under Din's direct protection, Din would be free to lead the New Mandalorians against whatever forces and allies Boba has surmounted. 

I believe Din Djarin will bring the Mandalorians into a new age of cooperation with the Jedi, as he now has a connection to Luke through Grogu, and will ultimately proclaim his Mudhorn signet as the new symbol of Mandalorians once he has proven he is undoubtedly worthy to be the leader of Mandalore by either defeating Bo Katan in combat during a challenge to claim the dark saber or (my personal bitter-sweet hope) by slaying his now Beskar laden foil and soon to be Supreme of the Underworld: Boba Fett."

So, after Rise of The Skywalker, the First Order apparently was obliterated. So the two biggest governments in the galaxy are down. What will take their place?

I don’t think this will happen anytime soon. I think we have many adventures to have in the mandalorian era and beyond with Ezra, Thrawn, Sabine etc but I think it likely she will eventually meet Luke and Grogu while they are together. Perhaps Luke thinks they both die. Now I also know we need Grogu and Din to reunite if we are ever to feel joy again, so that’s why I don’t see it happening til quite a bit later in the timeline so they can have some more time together but eventually it could happen. Maybe Din survives past TROS anyway and they can have another reunion then. 

I just think it’s a clean way of having them be accountable for not being in the sequel trilogy, and also sets up very exciting storytelling possibilities post-TROS. Rogue Squadron is rumoured to take place in that time period so I think by then in we will hopefully being seeing some more sequel era content (that can explain and improve the messy/nonsensical aspects of the sequel trilogy). 

Eventually my wish would be an animated series set after TROS with Ahsoka and Grogu included as well as Rey, Finn etc but that’s a pipe dream.

Edit: please remember Ahsoka isn’t confirmed dead because she spoke to Rey at the end of TROS: https://io9.gizmodo.com/heres-what-dave-filoni-had-to-say-about-ahsoka-tanos-vo-1841797043

679,1608465930.0,StarWarsTheories,"Regarding the last episode. Theory/Story Arc. - Title is super-vague to avoid butthurtedness. After re-watching the season/arc finale, I had a few thoughts; of course, having to do with Grogu.   


I posit the theory or story arc, that Grogu, may be one way that Luke and therefore Anakin, bring balance to the force. The way I find this is that though the Mandolorians, and Jedi are 'eternal foes' that was not the case for Tarre Viszla, and as such had created the device to bond the two orders.   


Grogu, is both a Force User/(possible Jedi) and a Foundling. I could see a story arc that would be Luke, after giving sufficient knighthood training to Grogu would then start his vision series of what Ben would possibly become (if he hadn't been so hasty would Ben have turned?) contacts Din. To take him away; knowing the ""father/son"" connection that had formed.  


Given, we don't know galaxy-wide canon story between the finale and The Force Awakens; it is possible that a new Mandalore has risen. Another given would be the direct possession of the darksaber, won in combat, allows the bearer to ascend to the title of Mandalore; I theorize that it is possible that Din retrieves Grogu on Luke's behest to save him from Kylo. With the possession of the darksaber and the title of Mandalore, it is all possible that Grogu could inherit this will (whill) from Din upon his death or 'retirement'(for lack of a better description). Thereby balancing once again the 'racism' of Jedi and Mandalorians."

While I don't think either of those are out of the question, I think it would be a lot more interesting if Obi-wan was interacting with a Force Ghost that he thought was Anakin. In reality, this could be Sidious/Vader trying to lure Obi-wan out of hiding. Using Force abilities we are still exploring.

682,1608426183.0,StarWarsTheories,"Theory on the blue butterfly that Grogu sees at the Seeing Stone - So, after 'The Tragedy' episode, I saw some Star Wars fans on Twitter speculate that the blue butterfly that Grogu sees represents Ben Solo.

They concluded this, because in a [children's video about Ben](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kS7H75jQu0A&ab_channel=StarWarsKids) he is seen being carried by blue butterflies. Butterflies can represent the force in a broader sense.

Now, the season finale seems to not work with this theory, because the Jedi that shows up is [spoilers](https://www.thewrap.com/luke-skywalker-mandalorian-max-llyod-jones/)

However, I still think it's possible that the person Grogu contacted is Ben (around 4~), and that Ben told Luke.

Why does this matter? Because I think a really powerful theme is developing in this show with Ben's involvement. Din Djarin decided to let go of Grogu so that he could continue his force training. Similarly, Leia let go of Ben to train with Luke.

Now, we know just how harmful it was that Ben was isolated from his parents growing up. This is also indicated in the separation of Anakin from Shmi.

I think the show just might comment on this in some way and be the reason Grogu needs to return to Din. Because what's more important than force training is developing proper bonding with a parent or guardian."

I can’t get over the fact that Grogu is 50 years old and yet is also still very much a child. With some researching you come to find that Jedi Master Yoda was already given the rank of Jedi Master by age 100! So what’s the difference between these two? As we do not know nearly anything about their species. I then started wondering maybe they age with their mastery of the force or atleast with the use of it; something we do know is that this species does indeed have a high midichlorian count. It seems to me that this species NEEDS the force to exist; maybe being why there’s not many of them we know about? So in layman’s terms what I’m trying to say is, What if because of Baby Yoda having to suppress his force abilities and halt his training over the years following order 66.. what if that’s the reason he doesn’t to be appearing to be aging. Because his species literally needs the force to age! Idk just a thought what’re y’all’s opinion!?"

687,1608348792.0,StarWarsTheories,"Grogu and Mando theory - I have found many similarities in the last scene of the Mandolorian to the scene where Han Solo is killed by Kilo Ren. These similarities could be a large hint to what will happen with the Baby Yoda and Mandolorian trilogy, where the Mandolorian has to kill Grogu due to him going to the dark side. Maybe the padawan that went to the dark side that Luke was training was not Kylo Ren but was actually Baby Yoda and that is why Luke went incognito.

The similarities are- 

1. There are armed stormtroopers and people all around Kylo Ren and Han Solo. All of the other Mandolorians and Bobo Fett are standing armed behind Mando as he approaches Luke.

2. Han Solo tells Kylo Ren to take off his mask. Grogu tells the Mandolorian to take off his mask.

3. The way Kylo Ren puts down his mask is the exact same as the way that the Mandolorian put it down. Even the camera was in the exact same place.

4. Grogu touches Mando’s face the exact same way that Han Solo touches Kylo Ren’s right as Kylo Ren kills him.

5. Mando says to Grogu “Alright pal it’s time to go” and Han Solo says to Kylo “Leave here with me come home”.

6. When Kylo Ren said “I know what I have to do but I don’t have the strength to do it. Will you help me” and Han Solo says “yes, anything”, this scene is very similar to the scene where Mando says to Grogu “Don’t be afraid.”

7. Right before Kylo Ren kills Han Solo he stares blankly at Han. His teary eyed stare is almost identical as Mando’s stare right before putting down Grogu.

8. The scene where Grogu is looking up at Mando hugging his leg could be a hint to what he will look like after Mando has killed him. It could also be a hint to Baby Yoda being killed and falling off a ledge into the abyss, because of the similar overhead camera angle of Han falling into the bottomless pit after being killed by Kylo Ren.

9. Lastly r2-d2 coming in after Grogu has been put down and freaking out is very similar to when Chewbaca, Rey and, Fin were freaking out after Han was killed.

Now there’s plenty of years worth of story to fill and I’m sure we’ll get it all eventually but ever since the blue butterfly showed up in ep 6, I had this idea of baby yoda eventually having a friendship with young Ben. Today’s episode makes it that much more likely. There’s a good 18/19 years between this and the destruction of lukes temple so I’m sure Grogu and young Ben would have met and had a childhood friendship! 

Does anyone else think there’s a chance of that? The blue butterfly is a vague thing but it has come to symbolise Ben in the fandom and also there are a lot of theories around Ben and the World Between Worlds and grogu obviously seemed to have a strong connection with that too in episode 6 when he activated the stone thing, which was a much more dramatic visual than we’ve ever seen for someone just reaching out with the force. 

I don’t expect people to agree with or like this one but my extreme theory is that Grogu will eventually become a bit of a WBW master (potentially after coaching from Ahsoka and/or Ezra) and will eventually do a bit of time travel, perhaps jumping forwards to AFTER Ep 9 and meet up with Rey and help her reconnect with Ben through the WBW.

So far a lot of the ""interquel"" content has served a dual purpose. Firstly, its awesome and is great star wars content, but as a secondary agenda Disney has been using this opportunity to strengthen the weak points and plot holes of the other movies. Rogue One solves the issue of the Death Star being designed with a critical failure point. Solo retcons making the Kessel run in 12 parsecs because parsecs is a distance measurement but he takes a shortcut. The Clone Wars did wonders for expanding the unseen motivations in episode 3. Some even think Mando has attempted to retcon Boba's kinda lackluster defeat at the Sarlaac pit by implying he has used spice. 

To me, and to many other fans, the most glaring plothole and biggest disappointment of the sequel trilogy was Luke turning on his nephew so easily. Now Grogu is under Luke's care and through Grogu we may see more about Lukes jedi temple and his class of younglings that he attempted to train. This would be a great opportunity for Disney to rationalize Luke's attack on Ben. I'm not sure what format (animated, live action series, or movie) this would take, but it would be great to see Luke's transformation between the Return of the Jedi and The Last Jedi. Perhaps he is delving into ancient Jedi knowledge that frightens and disturbs him, perhaps a more powerful young apprentice (Grogu) does stray to the dark side, leaving Luke a cautious and jaded old man. I dont know what will happen that could convince fans that Luke is also fallible, but it seems like this could be what they are winding up to do."

700,1608236121.0,StarWarsTheories,"Grogu turning evil, to become a villain of FUTURE narratives? - If you prefer to listen rather than read and look at some cool related concept art while doing so, feel free to check this out:

[https://youtu.be/nBo5efIxF5E](https://youtu.be/nBo5efIxF5E)

 I feel like him turning evil, falling to the dark side of the force is a strong possibility  that we might see play out in future narratives.  

Lets start off with three main points I'd like to make.

The first one being: 

Morality and Spirituality are the core themes of Star Wars. 

The struggle between the light side and the dark has been present throughout all types of Star Wars media.

The Force constantly strives to balance itself out and the endless cycle of conflict repeats itself. 

While Grogu's constant struggle with the lure of the dark is an interesting concept, I think it would be even more interesting to see the opposite of Yoda's character in

Star Wars. Imagine if like 10 years down the line, when we get another trilogy of movies that occur hundereds of years after the sequels, the main antagonist of the future narrative is Grogu. 

&#x200B;

Which brings me to my 2nd point.

It would be a unique twist that feels a lot like something that George Lucas would do. 

I am sure most of you remember the viral reddit post that made the Darth Jar Jar theory famous.

Many fans speculated that Jar Jar was meant to be a main antagonist of the prequels but given an extremely poor reception to the movie and that specific character, Lucas was pressured to abandon the idea, possiblby by other creatives involved in the project that advised him on things. 

As much as I dig the idea of a comic relief character that turns out to be the big bad of the saga, I don't think George planned such an arc for that character. 

Perhaps he considered making him a secret, evil force user but I think Palpatine was always the literal devil, the grand villain of the Star Wars universe in George's eyes.

Plus, George Lucas is not the one to give in to others. He always liked to experiment and take risks. With that being said,

I might be wrong and perhaps Jar Jar was indeed meant to be the main villain of the prequels from the start. 

&#x200B;

And last but not least, my 3rd point: Its like poetry, it rhymes.

If Grogu were to be a villain in future Star Wars projects, his path could very much mirror that of Anakin / Vader. The main difference being, that we first got to know Anakin as Vader. This time around, we first were introduced to Grogu as this little cute, innocent being rather than an absolute evil, more machine than man. 

Imagine the reaction of the audience, assuming that in a new trilogy of movies all of the sudden we are introduced to Grogu as the main villain. It would surely be risky and not everyone would be pleased with it but if done right with enough exposition that makes sense, I think it could totally work. 

Star Wars is filled with parallels and while it might seem simplistic at first glanace to have such reoccuring storylines, simplicity is not necessairly bad.

You can have complex storytelling that is both good and bad, good being something like Knights of the Old Republic 2 and bad The Last Jedi that many felt was completely out of touch with what Star Wars is at its core. 

If Grogu were to become a villain, I don't think we'd see it happen in the current Phase if you will, of Star Wars projects (Phase being a term that is also used by the Marvel Cienatmic Universe). 

The main reason for this is not even Grogu's age though obviously for continuity sake, he probably should not be able to wield a lightsaber anytime soon. It is simply that he has no place in the current story given the sequel trilogy.

So, would you like to see Grogu be the main villain of future Star Wars content or do you hate the idea? I'd love to hear your thoughts!

I'd just like to add that this was being set up for a while now and while nothing might come out of the conflict within Grogu, if it does happen and we are given additional exposition, I feel it could totally make sense and make for a good story in the future (and by future I mean far future). Let me know what you think, hope I don't get hated for this haha, I realize many people might not want to see this happen, at least without experiencing the related story firsthand."
701,1608191411.0,StarWarsTheories,"Vader Line in A New Hope is the beginning of his redemption. - “When I left you, I was but the learner. Now I am the master.”

I’ve been thinking about this line from A New Hope and what it could mean when Obi Wan and Vader fight again in the new D+ show in the “rematch of the century”. If this takes place 9 years after Revenge of the Sith than how can Vader still be a “learner”?

Then I remembered he’s not a master...he never was. He’s an apprentice after Sith to Sidious. He’s still an apprentice in A New Hope. 

Maybe what that line means now is it’s the first indication he’s moving towards the light. He finally meets Obi wan for a third fight and his emotions get the better of him. This is what you’re taught as a Sith to fight with your emotions. He uses the term “master” even though he’s not.  It’s the first time he is defying Darth Sidious by rejecting the master and apprentice dynamic and anointing himself as “Master”.  This defiance, this line is the beginning of his redemption.

702,1608174967.0,StarWarsTheories,"Mando - Who Saved Grogu from Order 66 Theory - I am surprised I havent seen this one mentioned, maybe I am missing something...

I think Palpatine saved Grogu from Order 66. The dude planned for everything, had an array of plans backup plans galore, he was the senate, and orchestrated the clone wars. 

Its pretty plausible that after or just before he communicated order 66 rescued he, or had one of his aids, rescue grogu. The motivation behind this could be two fold.

1. To have a much younger (relative to Grogus age timeline) potential apprentice in case Annikan fails

2. As an intentional source for high m count blood for future cloning experiments. These experiments could have been intended to build the clone army at a force sensitive scale, create someone like snoke, or as a long term contingency plan for his own potential downfall (he was familiar with the story of Darth Plagueis the Wise)

Just a thought... he was definitely busy when all that went down, but could see him being interested in having a backup plan or experiment of sorts. Of course this means that at some point Grogu would have had to fall out of Palpatines control - this would have to be explained maybe through some other content like bad batch or literally anything else, (spoiler) rumored that Obiwan did have to leave Tatooine for a bit"

704,1608137857.0,StarWarsTheories,"Inquisitorius, Barriss ALIVE, Ahsoka, Cody, Kenobi tie-in and more - My Bad Batch Theories - If you prefer to listen rather than read and look at some cool related concept art while doing so, feel free to check this out:

 [https://youtu.be/8g40OsNZj1U](https://youtu.be/8g40OsNZj1U) 

It is no secret that many more seasons of the Clone Wars were planned .

After Disney acquired Lucasfilm the show was canceled but many of the story arcs were told through different types of media, novels, comic books and so forth. 

Plus, obviously, we got 2 more seasons even though they were much shorter than the other ones. 

Still, Some stories never saw the light of day in any form.

Which brings me to **Barriss Offee**. Dave Filoni explicitely stated that he had plans for that character past the 5th season of the Clone Wars. He didn't reveal anydetails but one can speculate. Many thought that we would see Barris in Rebels as an Inquisitor but that did not happen. I am thinking The Bad Batch might be the perfect opportunity to close out the story arc of that character.

The Bad Batch takes place right after the end of the Clone Wars and will explore the early days of the Galactic Empire.

Given the scene from the trailer which is basically a ROTS tie-in similar to another scene from the seventh season of the clone wars, I am thinking the very first episode might take place at the same time as the Siege of Mandalore.

Here is my theory: Eventually clone force 99 will be tasked with hunting down jedi. Who else is hunting jedi at this time? Other than vader, the inquisitors. Yeah, my guess is that we will get to see some inquisitors in The Bad Batch and learn more about how they came to be. The Fallen Order plus Vader comics already delved into that to some extent but much is still uknown about the Inquisitors, especially about how Palpatine recruited them early on. Were all jedi given a choice by Anakin/Vader to join him during the jedi temple raid or did Palpatine contact some mebers of the order prior to order 66? 

Krell might be an example of a jedi who was recruited to eventually became an agent of evil, though we know he was approached by Dooku but perhaps Dooku was simply doing what Sidious told him to do. 

So, how does Barriss play into all this? Well, it is likely that at the time of order 66 she is impriosned by The Republic. As The Republic is transformed into the Empire and jedi are no more, Palpatine can do whatever he wishes with her. What if Vader actually tasks Barriss with tracking down Ahsoka after the former is made an Inquisitor? 

Barriss knew Ahsoka well and would be a perfect candidate for such a task. This would also give some closure to the conflict between those two that wasn't really resolved in The Clone Wars.

Its not that they hated each other, Ahsoka actually thought that Barris made some valid points about the Republic and the jedi but obviously went about things in a completley wrong way and shouldn't have killed anyone. Still, seeing those two confront each other again has a lot of potential to explore some cool notions I feel.

&#x200B;

Also, my guess is that THe Bad Batch will somehow tie into Kenobi and depending on how many seasons it will have, at some point it might act as a prelude to Kenobi. Obviously one will be able to watch Kenobi without seeing the Bad Batch but if Inquisitors and Jedi Hunters appear in Kenobi, the Bad Batch might explain how they came to be. 

Cody also has some history with the clone force 99 and my guess is that we will see him in both the Bad Batch and Kenobi. As for his appearance in Kenobi, that warrants a separate thread lol.

Though all this raises some concerns: if they introduce so many different CRUCIAL characters, won't the bad batch, the actual main protagonists of the series, be sidelined as a result? I think

if things are done right, not necessairly. Perhaps The Bad Batch ends up saving Ahsoka if the writers will want the clone force 99 to split away from the empire at some point. Might be that 

Rex will try to contact some clones such as Wolfe and Gregor and Cody and get their inhibitor chips removed with the help of the Bad Batch. Honestly, I am really excited about this series as you can 

probably tell, there is so much to explore with it and I think they will surprise, in a really good way.

705,1608129345.0,StarWarsTheories,"5 THINGS that will happen in the upcoming Mandalorian episde - My Predictions for the Mandalorian Season 2 Finale [potential spoilers, duh] - If you prefer to listen rather than read and look at some cool related concept art while doing so, feel free to check this out:

[https://youtu.be/\_mwOhhl-DWo](https://youtu.be/_mwOhhl-DWo)

The Season 2 finale of the Mandalorian is just days away and I think it will leave us all in awe. They were not messing around this season and introduced so many new characters. It is only fitting that the finale should top all that came before which seems like quite a task.

Here are my 5 predictions on what we might expect from this season finale:

1. A duel between Din Djarin and Moff Gideon

This was being set up for a while now in a number of episodes and I think we are going to see a duel betwen those two with Din Djarin wielding his pure beskar spear and Moff Gideon the Darksaber.

Now, you'd think that if they do fight, only one of them will come out on top. Could Din Djarin die? I think it is extremely unlikely unless this was the last season but we now know that The Mandalorian was renewed for the 3rd season. So Gideon? I think so and his death might pave way for a new antagonist such as Thrawn.

&#x200B;

2. Which brings me to number 2: We can hear Thrawn speaking to Gideon or perhaps even see him.

With Thrawn involved, could it be that the New Republic will take interest in what is happening? Could we see an actual space battle? I think it is possible, this could also act as a set up for the Rangers of the New Republic.

&#x200B;

3. Bo-Katan makes a comeback

Bo-Katan clearly has some unresolved buisness with Gideon and before he dies, she should confront him to reclaim the Darksaber. Could it be that she will aid Din Djarin in his fight

against Gideon? I think it is extremely likely. Though with Bo and The New Republic, it is getting a little crowded and still think that Din Djarin should be the one to take down Gideon.

With Bo returning, we might also see Djarin finally abondening the creed. This is clearly being set up and at the very least I think we might see his face again. Possibly season 3 will delve more into how he struggles with what he was brainwashed to believe since childhood.

&#x200B;

4. Dark Troopers appear and one of the main characters, one of the good guys mind you, dies.

I am guessing Greef Karga will be the one to bite the dust but it could also be Fennec or Mayfeld though I think we will see more of them in Rangers of the New Republic or the Boba Fett show.

Dark Troopers will be the ones to deal the killing blow or Moff Gideon.

&#x200B;

5. Force User that Grogu contacted on Typhon appears at the end

I don't think the said force user will aid Din Djarin in his fight against Gideon since that would take too much away from that accomplishment plus with Bo\_katan helping, Gideon is in enough trouble as it is.

So who will that force user be? Well, it could be a new character but I am thinking they will reuse an already established character given how they've been trying to reference all kinds of canon material.

I am thinking Luke, Ezra or Cal Kestis. My money is on Luke but this has tons of implications which is why I am reluctant to say I am certain...

I suppose it could be Ahsoka but it seems weird to me that she sent mando away to find another jedi only to appear again and answer Grogu's call. I think we won't see anymore of her until the next season or even her own live action series.

I know some content creators speculated that Windu will make a comeback but I find that extremely unlikely. I think we will most definitely get more stroies with Windu but if he ever returns, he should do it to confront Vader and possilby die doing so. More on that later in another video perhaps.

&#x200B;

6. Grogu uses the Force like never before

I feel like Grogu was very much a background character this season and while I understand that such is his role in this series to an extent, I think we should also see him grow in some way as a character. I feel like Grogu will do something that will leave us speechless in this next episode.

Well, this is it for my predictions, I'd love to know what you think might happen in the season finale so be sure to let me know and may the force be wtih you, always."

707,1608010980.0,StarWarsTheories,"Ahsoka's Outfit in SWTCW - Does anyone know why Ahsoka does not wear traditional Jedi robes? I have seen a few posts about this on various subreddits and forums, but none gave a conclusive answer.

Shaak Ti is the only other Togruta Jedi I remember seeing, and she wears the robes. Ahsoka has only worn the cloak, but not the robes themselves. The only other Padawan I have seen not wearing traditional robes is Barriss; she wears robes similar to her master, Luminara, as they are the same species. 

I understand if it could be a cultural idea, or a statement against the sexualization of her species (as Aayla Secura did), but then I would think that Shaak Ti would wear something similar. 

Note this is specifically for the majority of the show SWTCW, when she is a Padawan learner.

Edit: I understand she is not a Jedi, and that she leaves the order, that Barriss is also a Padawan who doesn’t wear the robes, etc. My question is regarding when she IS a padawan. Please do not comment to explain to me that she is not a Jedi."
708,1607971937.0,StarWarsTheories,"Star Wars: Force Unleashed 2 is why Snoke exists and Rise of Skywalker happens. - Ok, this is my first time here and I'm not sure if I'm in the wrong place. But, this is my personal headcanon and my household headcanon. 

I believe Force Unleashed 2 is the perfect prequel for the sequel trilogy and completes it strangely enough. 

We all know the plot t ok Force Unleashed 2. Darth Vader creates a fully functional, living clone of Starkiller thar arguably possesses the soul of the original, and it goes berserk, trying to kill Vader in the process.  Well, I think that the endings of Force Unleashed 2 lead right into what happens in Rise of Skywalker perfectly. 

It definitely gives weight to Kylo ""finishing what his grandfather started."" 

Firstly, we wonder about the cloning tech used to create Snoke and recreate Palpatine. The Mandalorian is in the process of exploring this, but I believe Force Unleashed 2 ties in as well. Force Unleashed 2 sort of implies that Darth Vader has successfully found a way to do in secret what Palpatine has been searching to find for decades: revive. 

I want to believe that everything being done in the Mandalorian is happening because Palpatine became aware of what happened in Force Unleashed 2 and realized that Rahm Kota and his forces wrecked Kamino. I partially believe that is why we haven't seen Kamino: the research was destroyed. Palpatine and other imperial remnants are doing their best to fill in their blanks. 

I don't believe the original Snoke was a clone. Yes, I know, wild... but I believe that the vats with Snoke inside in Rise of Skywalker are attempts by Palpatine to recreate the process done onto Galen Marek in Force Unleashed 2. Although Palpatine has managed to revive himself somehow, we can see it obviously isn't stable. I think Palpatine took Snoke and used the Force Unleashed 2 cloning process overseen by Darth Vader to try to recreate Snoke as he was before he died. 

It adds weight to Rise of Skywalker because it would suddenly make everything from Palpatine being back  to the sith science involved apart of Vader's legacy. Basically, I theorize that the events of Force Unleashed 2 are what eventually cause everything that happens after episode 6."
709,1607967354.0,StarWarsTheories,"The Acolyte is Mara Jade - Theory - Lesley Headland's new TV series is a female-centric mystery-thriller set around the final days of The High Republic, where ""dark side"" powers seem to loom, possibly hinting at the rise of Darth Plagues. (And just to note: That while the current High Republic Era works seem to start with the Nihl and Sentient Energy-Sucking Plants, Making Star Wars originally believed there may be something akin to ""Sith Gods"").

So why Mara Jade you ask?

1. The word Acolyte is curious word, as it suggests it's not an ""apprentices"" per say, but some kind of ""religious affiliate"" knowingly or unknowingly doing someone else's bidding on behalf of whatever the Acolyte ""believes to be true"". In the former EU, Mara Jade was one of Darth Sidious' Hands and ""Hand"" could be another word synonymous with Acolyte.
2. While this would obviously be a re-imaging of sorts (to give the character some freedom/meaning in her own right that isn't perfectly predictable), there are enough elements to make this both familiar and fresh that could fit into the vague narrative we have. You would get a story about the struggles of ""grey"" force user being used, whose also a smuggler (as she searches for Dark Side artifacts or geological locations), a good Pilot who can navigate unknown region (where Dark Side materials seem to reside), and a potential love story that causes her to rebel against the thing she thought she believes in, *eventually*.

So what about the ""Skywalker"" part of Mara Jade ""Skywalker""?

This is a bit more tricky, because there are a few things Disney could do here to still make that relationship true, besides a reverse Luke story...

1. A Skywalker by ""proxy"". If we would be dealing with unknown regions and true to former EU material in that Mara Jade dealt with the Chiss, then she may be referred to as a ""skywalker"" via Timothy Zahn's current canon that those with certain force powers, notably young female (Chiss), could still be called this by The Chiss.
2. She is a Skywalker Descendant. Remember we still don't really understand why Shmi was Shmi Skywalker. Could she have more ""Skywalkers"" in her family???
3. Love story with Luke Skywalker across Space-Time. Ok, this is a bit far out, but given that we do have The World Between Worlds (and Sidious did try to enter it, which also begs the question of Plagues knew about it?) and Force Dyads, there is still potential that Luke and Mara Jade could meet somehow and that Luke could still have offspring, even if in another time.

Other ideas that have crossed my mind: If like in previous EU, there were more than one hand to the Emperor, then I could also easily see this being about more than one Acolyte to Plagues or another Sith Lord. This would add to struggle of the main characters' plight. There is also something about the Acolyte Key art that reminds me of Kyo Ren, which ""Ben Skywalker"" was originally Mara Jade's and Luke's son in the former Eu. In the current canon Kylo Ren was manipulated by Snoke via Sidious, but like ***The Acolytes of the Beyond***, was obsessed with his grandfather, and was considered to be (although this may have all been a ruse to motivate and use Ren) one of The Emperor's **""heir to the Empire"".**

710,1607820711.0,StarWarsTheories,"Theory about how Vader and Obi Wan come to cross blades in “Kenobi” - Kathleen Kennedy says Hayden Christiansen and ewan mcgregor will cross blades again in Kenobi. My theory is that obi wan didn’t know anakin survived at first, and the dark side had tainted his presence so obi wan couldn’t feel him. 

Once obi wan finds out a Anakin is alive, he tries to turn Vader one more time. Perhaps he felt guilty about leaving him to burn on Mustafar and wants to see if there is good in him. 

They will battle and this time obi wan will fail and Vader will leave him for dead. Then the line “he’s more machine then man” makes sense because he’d actually see anakin as Vader.

 And the line “obi wan once thought as you do” when talking to Luke would make more sense because he’d be referencing the fact that obi wan once believed anakin could be be saved.

As it stands that line doesn’t make as much sense without obi wan trying to turn him again."

He somehow he kept him hidden from the empire, and some time after the fall of the empire, started the experiments on him.

It gives Obi-Wan a legitimate reason to need to leave Tatooine, it is a big enough story to justify a mini-series over a movie, it allows any character Obi-Wan has ever interacted with to interact with him again, and once again Sidious would meddle and send Vader into Obi-Wan's vision to fight him. It would be the real Vader fighting the real Obi-Wan, but they would never physically meet, which I think is kinda important.

I could really see this being the WandaVision of Star Wars. Way too big and weird to be a movie, but PERFECT as an event series. You delve into who Obi-Wan is, you can get Qui-Gon, Yoda, Ahsoka, and, of course, Anakin all in there in different capacities, you see some new aspects of the force. I think it would be incredible."

The boring obvious answer is that there will be another republic (a new new republic if you will). But what I think will happen is that the galaxy will have a ton of independent planets, maybe a few factions within there. So why? Well in the last jedi they talk about how the resistance is funded by the same war machine and has a lot of flaws- but they never really expanded on that, in the newest episode of the mandalorian they expand on this idea with the morally neutral characters and mayfeld talking about how the new republic is considered an invader to the people on morac. The new republic also seems to have been a complete failure. So what would be the logical next step? The people of the galaxy being independent planets- this makes a lot of sense within the rise of skywalker as well since the resistance is small and relied on random people throughout the galaxy to rise up.

720,1607708415.0,StarWarsTheories,"Jar-Jar Binks's Character Might Make Sense it it's Meant to be Symbolic of Something Really Deep - Prior to the Trade Federation taking over Naboo and Palpatine turning the peaceful Old Republic into the domineering war machine that was the Galactic Empire, it's safe to assume that the threat of war, excessive violence, and chaos wasn't very high. It was a time of peace.  


In times of peace, people tend to be more carefree, lax, and even goofy and silly at times because they feel there's no immediate threat to their lifestyle. Though foolish and clownish behavior may be frowned upon, as long as it doesn't cause a lot of trouble, people are allowed to act that way.  


That's what Jar-Jar Binks's character may represent. Though he may get a lot of backlash for his behavior, the point is he grew up in a time of carefree peace, so he was ALLOWED to act that way prior to the war causing him to have to mature a bit.

Darth Maul kidnapped Grogu from the jedi temple. First, let's look at what we know about Grogu. His backstory is somewhat mysterious, but we know from Ashoka that he was at the jedi temple and then was taken away, likely during order 66. His memory the goes dark for a number of years after which he is more reluctant to use the force. The thing that bugs me about Grogu, is that of his limited force abilities, he has used a force choke move several times.

Now let's look at Maul. At the time of order 66 he was taken captive by Ashoka. But he was looking for *Skywalker.*  He knew  a lot about what was going on, and his goal was to get to Obi-Wan and Anakin. Especially after he learns that the clones have betrayed the jedi, I think he would be eager to catch them with their pants down. So I think after we see him escape the ship in the Clone Wars, he flies straight to the Jedi temple on Coruscant to find Anakin. 

In an unseen moment during the purge at the jedi temple, Maul confronts Anakin to convince him that he's being used as a tool by Palpatine, as Maul was used himself. They duel, but Anakin has not yet mastered the dark side and Maul escapes. On his way out he snatches up his new apprentice. 

This would set Maul up to finally finish his storyline. There is a huge gap for his character between his criminal empire in clone wars and Solo and him being stranded on Malicore in rebels. The story of his fall from grace still needs to be told, and I think Grogu could fit nicely into that tale."

Rowan is a boy jedi around the time of the original trilogy that specializes in building through the force and crosses paths with Luke and Leia once or twice, later working with the rebellion. He is also the main character in a 2 season (3rd coming soon) Lego Star Wars Tv show on Disney plus.

Alright so obviously thats not cannon. However... but... maybe... they could introduce him formally as cannon through this Grogu introduction. He would be mid 20s around this time. All the actions in the original
series do not conflict with or alter known cannon, all the tracks are covered and the creators of the show worked with Filoni and star wars ownership intentionally to ask what they were and werent allowed to do to make sure the show never contradicted cannon. Either way you cant tell me
Its not a possibility. Would probably be easier to take a mostly unknown that has already be refined and introduce them to everyone than making up a full new character. Also the shows not bad better than Resistance kid Show and tbh feels like more star wars like rebels and clone wars if you ignore the legos"
724,1607487731.0,StarWarsTheories,"[Star Wars Theory] Rey’s actual origin is far weirder than you think. How revelations from new media and The Rise of the Skywalker novelization expand Rey’s heritage. - Spoilers ahead for *The Rise of Skywalker* and *Mandalorian.*

**Rey’s origin is weird.** Technically she’s the daughter of a modified clone of Palpantine and an unnamed (presumably) human mother. As a partly bio-engineered being, (strand-casts as the new-canon calls them) this makes Rey’s origin a little more complex than just a direct descendant of Palpantine.

The *Mandalorian* continues to expand the *Star Wars* lore, we’ve learned that the empire had gene-farms for creating bio-engineered beings and that Moff Gideon hunted Jedi to harvest their genetic material for creating force-sensitive strandcasts.

Now, from *TROS* novelization we know that Palpantine’s son was a non-identical clone/strand-cast that was modified. These mods could include a cocktail of all the genetic material that Dr Pershing collected… which means Rey could be much more than just a descendant of Palpantine; her make-up could include a myriad of genetics from legendary Sith and Jedi.

I know the line is figurative in the *TROS* but she could literally be the culmination of  “all of the Jedi”.

Luke also realized the flaws of the jedi and before restarting the order went on a quest to gather knowledge. A lot of potential ways this could be written to make sense, really excited!

- Snoke said he was there throught he rise and fall of empire
- We have seen Grogu’s dark side in the latest episode
- Grogu mirrors the whole Anakin-do-not-train-him-because-attachments idea
- Snoke’s sitting in a chair all the time and has Force powers, he is probably tired from using Force powers too much like Grogu’s sleepiness (I know this one is a big stretch)

I think Ezra is going to become a rebooted version of Darth Krayt. I believe it happens after he vanishes with Thrawn I think he was captured experimented on and was left to rot on Korriban as some weird experiment to see how he'd react to a planet like Korriban that's full of the dark side of the force.

Part of why I think he'd be stranded on Korriban is it makes logical sense to put a jedi on the one planet everybody is afraid of and it'd be a fate worse than death in some respects. This way no jedi would find him and no one would be stupid enough to even go to Korriban so it'd be perfect for stranding him. I imagine he'd be driven insane by the dark side and the sith spirits that haunt the planet.

I can see it being revealed Ezra's developed weird regeneration with the side effect of himself being experimented on by Thrawn. I can also see a major draw back being that his wounds cause his body to mutate giving him his scary appearance. I love this idea because I can just see a mutation changing his appearance and representing the dark side taking over him. Also him being stranded on Korriban exploring the planet and Sith history would be a good way for him to create his empire as Darth Krayt.

Besides Korriban has never made a live action appearance so that'd be awesome."

So as he says, Grogu could be one of the padawans that Cere Junda was hiding, but gave up after being tortured. 

Here’s my addition. When the padawans were taken by the Empire, one Imperial (non clone) sees that Grogu is just a baby and hides him. He eventually is out into carbon freeze and hidden. After the fall of the Empire, people go into whatever Imperial base he was hidden in and find him. They let him out and he starts using the force on them, which is when they take him.

The carbon freezing idea could be an answer as to why Grogu is still a baby at 50, though Yoda was training Jedi at 100. The carbon freezing stopped him from aging, which I believe is also what happened to Kix. That’s also why Grogu said his memory went dark.

Then, after all of his Force activity, some imperial somehow realizes that he’s there, and puts a bounty on him. I’m going to assume that the Imperial Remnant had no idea just how Force sensitive Grogu was, which they find out when Dr Pershing does his tests. That would be why they simply put a bounty on him instead of doing it themselves."

I’ve seen the theory floated about that Boba will die and Din will have Slave 1 as his new ship, but I just can’t see that being a possibility, and here’s why: 

 The Mandalorian started off as a show about Din being a bounty hunter taking jobs to help his clan survive. That’s changed now, and with how intertwined Din’s story is with Grogu’s now, and the expansion of the universe with Bo-Katan being back, The Mandalorian will become a show about the retaking of Mandalore and restoring the race as a force in the galaxy. So that leaves a void in the whole “space-western bounty hunting show” category...

That’s where the new Boba Fett show comes in. It’ll be a spin-off to Mando and fill the void the show is leaving with Boba restoring his status as THE top bounty hunter in the galaxy. Boba doesn’t consider himself a Mandalorian, he doesn’t care about helping restore Mandalore and the clans: he cares about being the best hunter in the galaxy. 

We’ll get flashbacks to his time after the Sarlacc and maybe even his younger days (Daniel Logan would love to play Boba again) and the show will mostly center around him and Fennec taking bounties across the galaxy. That’s where we’ll get our seedy Star Wars underworld/ space western fix"
733,1607176447.0,StarWarsTheories,"Why I agree with Mace Windu/Child Theories - Theory (Spoilers 2.14) - So for a little while there have been some theories that believe Mace Windu somehow survived the fall and was the one to save the Child from the Temple.

After 2.06 (Chapter 14: The Tragedy), I believe they are right and this is also the Jedi Grogu called on Tython's Stone. But let me explain a little why...

This episode decided to bring Boba Fett more back into the fold of *The Mandalorian's* story where *Attack of the Clones* was referenced both by Boba Fett speaking of his father and some of his father's past, a juxtaposition can be drawn between Boba and Fennec with Jango and Zem, and with a through line back to Dr. Pershing (A Kimino Cloning Scientist), as Moff Gideon was able to get the Child in his hands once more.

But the irony here is also with fathers and sons as Din struggles to protect the Child at almost every turn and Boba Fett knows his father was lost when MACE WINDU killed him on the Genosis Battlefield. So helping him save the Child only to run into Mace, may be a very interesting direction to take and would greatly full circle things for Boba Fett.

In addition much like how I feel that Anakin Skywalker was a figurative ghost to the Sequel Trilogy's story, do I feel (Darth) Maul may be a figurative ghost to *The Mandalorian*, given his backstory with both Mandalore (and The Darksaber) and the Empire...

Maul is a character that was able to survive being cut in half and thrown down a shaft, which also ends up paralleling Sidious return, which The Child's story most likely plays into or helps make possible (clones, clones, clones). So there would be double irony that Mace Windu would survive his fight from Sidious.

In addition Fennec's survival with Boba saving her, also fits into this along with the Dark Troopers, as Mual (and Anakin) survived via cybernetic technology...

And lastely, and somewhat shallowly I might add, Gro-GU and Win-DU have some name similarity and feel like they could go hand in hand prose-wise."
734,1607134234.0,StarWarsTheories,"My theory for the Mandalorian - So, Recently I have been thinking about potential theories about the future of the Mandalorian. Here is what I came up with.

So every since the episode were we saw the episode with the clones in those tanks. and the doctor mentioning the ""m-count"" I went back and read the Darth Plagueis novel and ever since I haven't stopped thinking about how Darth Plagueis is behind everything. Even the sequels.  So if you haven't seen the Mandalorian there are spoilers here.

Since Plagueis was experimenting on all these different species in the book when they are in the bacta tanks and testing their midichlorians in a way to extend his life. So what if he had managed to survive Sidious trying to kill him and he disappeared maybe to exegol. And managed to extend his life all the way past the return of the jedi and wait for palpatine to get wiped out and darth vader to be gone. So in turn creating snoke and the first order. then corrupting the mind of Luke to make him exile himself on Ahch-to. to get him out of the way. And now with Ahsoka mentioning Thrawn and rewatching the end of rebels when ezra and thrawn got launched away. It may be that plagueis found thrawn and Ezra and he tried to work with Ezras midichlorians and failed. and now he wants Grogu (baby yoda) to finalize his tests. As well i believe that Ahsoka is onto thrawn and plagueis because when he was testing on ezra she felt some sort of disturbance around the time of the end of the return of the Jedi and since it was the dark side, the light side maybe created Rey as retaliation (similar to anakin). As well with palpatine returning in the rise of skywalker he could have found him in the death star and resurrecting him to return or even just taking his body and expirementing on him.

I don't think this is a high possibility but I like to think about this stuff, and me personally i would enjoy it if Darth plagueis was behind Every thing.

&#x200B;

But I haven't seen much discussion on the meditation stone in relation to the end of the episode, when Grogu is torturing those storm troopers.

So Grogu sits on the rock and once he's engaged with it suddenly he's surrounded by this massive impenetrable force-field... I don't recall ever seeing this sort of thing at all, much less through meditation. I'm stuck on this because it makes me wonder if through this meditation he gains back a bunch of his abilities. I mean we've never seen him lob people around and lift someone off the ground as a product of force choking.

To reiterate I feel like he must of realized greater power when he was creating the force-field--almost as if he was recharging; if I recall correctly whenever Yoda is meditating, e.g., looking into the future, or communicating with Qui-Gon, there's not this massive energy field protecting him.

To clarify, I have only seen bits and pieces of pieces of the Clone Wars and Rebels and I have not read a Star Wars comic in a long time, so if I'm missing something that's obviously been touched on there, please explain.

736,1607115442.0,StarWarsTheories,"Ezra after Rebels Theory, what happened to him, and how it links to The Mandalorian - I think he was taken prisoner by Thrawn, I think he was experimented on and went nuts eventually falling to the dark side. I say this because I think Moff Gideon and Thrawn are working together and I suspect before learning of the child Moff Gideon and Thrawn were using Ezra for their experiments but he escaped and then Grogu came into the picture and provided new opportunities that they lost with Ezra.

Now here's where I think things with the Mandalorian will come into play I think Ezra will have sensed Grogu but he won't be a jedi when he comes for him. I think he'll have fully snapped and probably have the same mindset as Darth Maul.

As for how he might appear I think after sensing Grogu he'll come for the child maybe attack at the same time as Mando and his friends but will claim to be an ally up until the end. I can see him barely holding his sanity together and getting more frustrated as Grogu refuses to go with him and is visibly frightened of him which Mando would likely pick up on. I really like this idea because I think it'd be a good way for Mando to learn about the sith and more about the history of the jedi.

I also think it'd be a very different challenge if it was a sith lord chasing Mando and Grogu. I also like the idea of Grogu unintentionally looking into the abyss metaphorically speaking when he reached out with the force and got the attention of a truly dangerous threat."

I believe Grogu is there to mature Din as a character so he can rejoin the Mandalorian and lead them through a new age.

It looked like a lothal cat to me and I feel like Filoni showing one on the episode that we see Ahsoka who went looking for Ezra is kinda a big foreshadowing in the background. Especially considering how attached to the cats Ezra was in rebels. I think possibly next season or when the Ahsoka show airs we might be getting some cross overs with Ezra, Ahsoka and Sabine or they show up more in Mandalorian before the other show comes out."

Think about just how much energy must be pouring out if a kyber crystal to power a light saber, in our universe nothing like that can exist without exploding.

However, one thing that seems to come easier in our universe is storing and using information, the best example is computers. The internet exists and mobile phones are prevalent. Look at the lack of displays on Star Wars ships, they don't have touch control or augmented reality. They may have holograms but they always look kind of shoddy, even ones owned by high ranking officials. They have droids but even the droids are not very smart. They still manually control their ships. Look at the massive data center in Rogue One! Sometimes it seems like they don't have the ability to make backups or encrypt data.

In the first episode’s firefight with The Mandalorian and IG-11, the pair face-off exclusively against Nikto, a famous race for pirates, mercenaries, etc., and more specifically the Ohnaka Gang or the Hutt Cartel. The closest connection between the two groups is Obi Wan, Hondo and their unique “friendship” (referenced in Rebels), and the supposed timeline of the show between III and IV further supports this, although I doubt it would be the entire basis for the show.

Additionally, every single theory that involves an established Force-sensitive character tagging along with Din to train Grogu is undoubtedly going to be wrong; a great way to overshadow the main character - even one as skillful as Din Djarin - is to pair him up with someone who can use the Force and lightsabers. The last thing you ever want to do with a show like this is to upstage or overshadow your main character on a regular basis.

The show is structured around Din and Grogu journeying together, much like the old Wolf and Cub stories (I know everyone loves to repeat this, but it's *extremely important* with regards to how the show is and will be structured). Removing the Cub part of Wolf and Cub diminishes the story.

My first reason for this is that Vos is pressured to have survived the Jedi Purge, making him one of very few that have yet to show up.

Second, Vos has been on both sides, light and dark, Sith and Jedi, meaning he would have no qualms teaching someone with emotional attachments like Grogu who Ahsoka refused to train due to his similarities to Anakin.

Thirdly if they ever wanted to get rid of him all they would have to do is turn him to the dark side again in somewhat of a boromir from LotR moment, deciding to take Grogu for himself away from the Mando to exact his revenge on the empire remnants. This would then causing the Mando to retaliate ending in the death of Quinlan Vos, maybe as a heroic sacrifice or maybe not.

Not a lot is known about what Ahsoka has been up to since the time of 'Rebels', except to say she \*appears to still be hunting down Thrawn to find Ezra Bridger.

This begged the question of if this episode takes place before the last scene, in the last episode, of ***Star Wars: Rebels***.

And the following is what Dave Filoni had to say about it:

“***It’s an interesting one, that’s not necessarily chronological,***” Filoni said. “***I think the thing that people will most not understand is they want to go in a linear fashion, but as I learned as a kid, nothing in*** **Star Wars** ***really works in a linear fashion. You do \[Episodes\] Four, Five, and Six and then One, Two, and Three. So in the vein of that history, when you look at the epilogue of*** **Rebels**, **you don’t really know how much time has passed. So, it’s** **possible** ***that the story I’m telling in*** **The Mandalorian** ***actually takes place prior to that. Possible. I’m saying it’s*** **possible.**”

&#x200B;

Many people have since speculated this to mean that the time period in *Star Wars: Rebel's* final scene would be retconned, as it was laid down somewhere (in a book) that it takes place 1 year after the Battle of Endor and we know from *Star Wars* official sources that *The Mandalorian* takes place 5 years after the Battle of Endor...

But I don't think that is what Mr. Filoni is saying at all....

Remember, before that final scene in '*Rebels'*, the last time we saw Ahsoka was when Ezra pulled her out of a portal when he was in the World Between Worlds. We understand from that episode that the World Between Worlds is a kind of astral plane *bridging* all of space and time together!

Ahsoka told Ezra that she could not go with him out of the ""current"" Lothal portal. So we don't know either where or WHEN she went or how she ends up in the final scene of the series!!!!!

So I purpose that **she went to the future and then went a bit back in time!** It's not that timeline is not linear, but Ahsoka's is not!"

With chapter 14 almost here, I want to give my theory on how that episode, as well as how chapters 15 and 16 will play out, and also Mando's character arc this season.

**Mando's Character Arc**

You get little hints of this in chapter 13, but I think Mando's character arc involves him having to let Grogu make his own choices. Since the end of season one, Mando's whole goal has been to bring Grogu to a Jedi for them to train. But, it's somewhat implied that Grogu doesn't want to. He wants to stay with Mando, and I think Mando will have to accept this, and rebel against the armorer (who has been proven to be the leader of a Mandalorian purist group/cult by Bo Katan in chapter 11), keeping Grogu with him on his many adventures.

**Chapter 14**

So, this will apparently be the shortest Mandalorian episode ever, at around 33 minutes. I think this will be an episode similar to chapter 10 and 11, with Mando needing something, and someone else having that thing, but in exchange for that thing, Mando must help them with something to get the thing he wants. I don't think the person with the thing will be a known character like Bo Katan, but rather a new character(s) (at first, I thought Cal Kestis and Cere Junda from Jedi: Fallen Order could be them, but if Mando is face-to-face with a Jedi, he doesn't need to go to Tython, so it would just be pointless). I don't really want to cover this episode further, as I think the other two episodes will be the most important.

**Chapter 15**

So, it begins with Mando and Grogu recklessly landing onto Tython, and they begin their journey to the Jedi temple. Meanwhile, Moff Gideon is informed that the Razor Crest has landed on Tython, and he takes this as the perfect opportunity to snatch him and Grogu up. He awakens the Dark Troopers, incredibly powerful droid Stormtrooper replacements, and they fly to Tython. 

Mando and Grogu eventually find the Jedi temple, an old, crusty, and somewhat in ruins place that is making Grogu a little uncomfortable with all of the Force coming out of it. Mando takes Grogu into the temple, where they find the ""seeing stone"" Ashoka was referring to either in the middle or at the end of it (it doesn't really matter). Mando plops Grogu down on it, and urges/forces him to reach out with the Force for other Jedi.

Suddenly, someone speaks to Mando from behind him:

""Who are you?""

Mando turns around to see Luke Skywalker, using his Force Projection from The Last Jedi to be there as well as wherever he really is at the same time.  Mando explains the whole situation, and urges Luke to train Grogu in the ways of the Force. Luke argues that arguably, it should be Grogu's decision, but, to Mando's chagrin, Grogu doesn't want to. Luke doesn't want to train someone against their will, and advises Mando that separating Grogu from him will only make Grogu's situation worse, and he disappears, which makes Mando a little angry.

Suddenly, the Dark Troopers storm the Jedi temple, and hold Mando and Grogu at gunpoint, capturing them and taking them with them back to Moff Gideon.

So, this sort of set ups chapter 16 to be kind of a prison break episode, as well as a season finale. But, I can't change too much that is already there, as there is a season 3 and most likely many more coming on the way after that (my original theory involved Baby Yoda leaving with Luke, Moff Gideon dying, Cara Dune joining the New Republic, and Bo Katan getting the Darksaber back, but as someone pointed out, it felt more like a *series* finale, and not just a season finale).

**Chapter 16**

Mando and Grogu are being kept in an Emperial base, Mando in a cell, and Grogu taken by scientists, including Doctor Pershing. Doctor Pershing eventually breaks Mando out of his cell and gives him his weapons back, saying that he doesn't want Grogu to die because of the Empire extracting more blood from him, and he needs Mando's help to break Grogu free.

Mando and Doctor Pershing storm the lab, killing the scientists and breaking Grogu free, who still has *some* blood extracted from him, so he's passed out. Mando thanks Doctor Pershing, and escapes the base, killing many Stormtroopers on the way.

Mando is stopped by Moff Gideon and his army of Dark Troopers, who are blocking his path. Mando is preparing to face this entire army himself, but suddenly, a fleet of New Republic X-wings fly overhead. They aren't really connected to Mando in any way, they're just here to stop this whole operation and destroy the base. 

The final fight of the season involves New Republic members fighting the Dark Troopers and trying to destroy the base, while Mando fights Moff Gideon, Mando using the Beskar spear given to him by Ashoka, and Moff Gideon using the Darksaber. Eventually, Tie Fighters are sent out to shoot down the X-wings, who are landing some good hits on the base.

 It looks like it's the end for Moff Gideon, with Mando getting the upper hand in the fight, the base being destroyed, and the Dark Troopers being somewhat taken down by New Republic soldiers (if two of them can take out a giant spider monster, I have no doubt a bunch of them can take out an army of strong droids). So, Moff Gideon retreats, leaving the Dark Troopers and just flying away on a Tie Fighter. This gives time for Mando to help the New Republic soldiers fight the Dark Troopers. Eventually, the base is destroyed, the Dark Troopers are shot down, and the New Republic is victorious. The New Republic thank Mando, and lets him go. Mando finally excepts that he should stick with Gorgu, and they two fly off together, continuing their adventures in season 3.

**Season 3**

Speaking of which, I also have a couple ideas on how season 3 could go. I do think we will get a Boba Fett episode, where Mando and him face off, before coming to an agreement of some sort and stop trying to kill each other. I also think we'll see more of Bo Katan looking for the Darksaber, as well as Mando coming to terms with the fact that the beliefs he has held since he was a child were actually made by a cult (maybe we'll get a confrontation with him and the Armorer, idk). Also, I think Moff Gideon will die. Having him for over 3 seasons would just be a bit too much, and I think they will finally kill him, and leave room for another villain, possibly Thrawn or someone like that."
751,1606883736.0,StarWarsTheories,"[Mandalorian Theory] Grogu will be trained by Ezra Bridger, not as Jedi, but a new way in the force. - Ahsoka outright refused to train poor little Grogu, citing that she has seen what can happen to the best of the Jedi when trained too late in their childhood. 

If Ahsoka knows the risks, why would she tell Din about the beacon on Tython and say another Jedi may be able to train Grogu?

My theory is that Ahsoka only knows how to train based on the Jedi teachings she experienced on Coruscant, which when applied to older children had devastating consequences. But… Ahsoka may know of another force-user who doesn’t adhere to Jedi Path; Ezra Bridger.

Ezra has been missing in action since 0BBY, but if Thrawn is back, then we can assume that Ezra has returned from the beyond as well. Ezra had a complicated relationship with force and teetered on the edge of the darkside at times in Rebels. 

He may have experienced a lot of new and exciting things in his travels in the unknown regions (or wherever the space whales took him). He could have learned new ways to apply and wield the force that doesn’t have the same consequences for training someone who’s too old.

Here’s my logic:

The Mandalorian has a running theme of breaking established creeds or traditions to do what’s morally right. Din breaks the guild laws, and seems to be breaking a bit from the Watch’s creed. Now I think Ezra will align with this narrative and show another light side path to follow for force-sensitives."
752,1606764486.0,StarWarsTheories,"Rey actually has Skywalker blood in her - So my theory is based on the fact that her father was a Palpatine Strandcast. A hybrid of a basic clone genetically engineered after many failed attempts. I suspect that Rey not only has Palpatine's blood in her, but that of Grogu, whatever was used to make Snoke, which I believe was part of Vader's DNA used with Palpatines.

So I believe the strandcast work using grogu's blood along with the emperors lead to a successful living recreation of palp. However I also believe that along with trying to create strandcasts of palpatine they had many failed Snokes. I think the palpatine clone we see in the 9th movie oversaw strandcast work involving his and vader's DNA to create the many failed snokes and it wasn't until Grogu's blood they created Rey's father. However after running out of Grogu's blood, they couldn't create the perfect emperor clone replacement for the palps we see in 9.

Palpatine + Vader + Grogu dna = Rey's dad"

Gideon will be catching up with Mando soon. I'm sure they'll make the fight seem impossible but something tells me that new spear will come in handy.

Does he give the saber back to the person who lost it to the person he just beat for it?

He was adopted by Clan Vizsla so he'll have Death Watch and traditionalists cool with the pick. I don't think Bo-Katan would mind too much so there's another big chunk of support. 

Din's already done some pretty legendary stuff and has good ties with the jedi and new republic. If he wins the dark saber the traditional way and has more ability to unite the clans than anyone I can think of, who else is the pick? 

Star Wars/Filoni typically doesn't make shows about characters who aren't pretty big deals. The last ensemble cast (Rebels) all turned into pretty big deals in their own right. This show is about one dude.

754,1606841523.0,StarWarsTheories,"Grogo Transformation Theory - So, as many of us now know, ""The Child"", also known as 'Baby Yoda' now has an official name per episode 2.05 (""Chapter 13 - The Jedi"").

So what's in a name?

*(Sorry about the header name being spelled wrong. Typing to fast)*

Grogu is a pretty great name IMO because it conjures up a few things. A more obvious gleam of the name might be an ""Asian-fied"" pun on the English word ""**grow"" or ""growing"",** as Children are often associated for growing both literally and figuratively (learning).

We also understand that this is a fundamental idea that comes form the more contemporary (in-universe) Jedi in terms of who they are willing to train, whether that be Yoda's initial fears to train Anakin or Ahsoka (who may not exactly be a text-book Jedi still) refuses to train the Child in similar fashion that Luke rejected training Rey (at first....

But Grogu also sounds familiar to other pop cultural icons.

One such icon is ***Dragon Ball's*** lead character, **Goku.** In the original  *Dragon Ball*, Goku is child who flies around on a cloud (nimbus), but has a mysterious tail. It turns out under the right conditions, Goku can (and does) transform into an almost uncontrollable raging beast called **""The Great Ape""**!

&#x200B;

But getting back to the growing idea, there are already pop-cultural mash-ups depicted of Grogu and ***Guardians of the Galaxy's*** **Groot**!

In the first 'Guardian's' film, Groot is apart of a species of sentient trees that are not able to communicate very well, like Grogu! At the end of the film Groot shows his loyalty when he is able to shield his friends, saying *""WE are Groot"",* implying that everyone he cares about is **connected (ie: like the nature of The Force)**. Somehow, Groot is **regenerated** into a baby sapling to start his life over again...

*So what am I getting at here?*

Well everything IMO is pointing to ***some kind of ""transformation"" ability***. Whether that's evolving into an older version of species, loosing memory and regenerating back into a child upon big Force usage or perhaps turning into another being or ""raw force energy"".  Could this also envolve a symbiotic relationship with Force Trees? Maybe???

In fact, we already know of another being that sort of does this. ***Star Wars Rebels*** introduced the being known as the **Bendu,** who literally **shape-shifts** into **geological structure** or even the **weather**!

There is also the fact that we also know a bit about **Celestial Force ""beings"" known as The Ones:** The Father, Son, Daughter, and once, The Mother. ""The Child"" sounds like something that could also play into the story of these beings. After all Ahsoka took the life force of Daughter and there is some expectation that it matters in terms of Ahsoka's long-term arc. So could the child being the reincarnation of some celestial force being and ""Yoda"" thing is some kind of ruse?

I'm not sure, but these were just some food for thought."
755,1606804459.0,StarWarsTheories,"Fett’s role in the show, if at all; - A lot of people have strong opinions on Fett and his appearance post S2E1.

With S2E4 and the experiments to me I feel like the route is an obvious. 
First we have to establish what we saw in episode 4, and what is going on.

The Empire is attempting to transfer high m count blood into bodies. These bodies are described as volunteers, so we assume that’s what they are. We can presume these tests are failing 

We also see clearly disfigured bodies in test tubes, judging by the fact they are disfigured we can assume these are also failures, and likely not the volunteers, as we have no reason to assume blood transfusions would cause that effect, especially in what is described as just over a fortnight.

My theory is we have two parallel projects with the same goal. One is to grow a clone. You can speculate that it’s for Palpatine, Snoke or just a super solder, doesn’t matter. The appearance of the scientist with a cloning guild emblem to me reinforces this.

The second part of the project is for whatever this lab grown organism is to accept high m count blood. Whether to make them a force sensitive soldier or susceptible to Sidious embodying.

Now where does Boba fit in? As far as we are aware Boba is a true, perfect clone of his father. No splicing to reduce aggressiveness or stomp out any negative traits his father had. He is the living perfection of cloning. 

This faction of the empire would be hunting him, along with the fact if the New Republic found out he lived, he’d certainly be one of the most wanted. 

Boba could have grabbed his armour whenever he wanted, and the idea that the defeat at Jabba made him retire is unlikely. He was tracking Din because he was seeing if someone was looking for him. He likely didn’t care that Vanth had his armour, and instead used him as an early warning system. 

If someone arrives and starts looking for him, what better way to get the heads up than keeping an eye on the guy wearing your iconic armor. 

I’m not sure his role in how he comes back into the story with Din, but I see his status of being a perfect clone as a huge connection to the empire experiments"
756,1606773543.0,StarWarsTheories,"(Spoilers) Moff Gideon is the founder of the first order and is in direct communication with palpatine - In episode 12 “the siege” moff Gideon is shown to be in possession/making dark troopers. But how would a small time imperial warlord, which is how he is presented now, afford something so expensive? Because palpatine funded it. He also, in the same episode, is shown to control a very high tech lab, capable of midiclorian research.  I doubt everyone is very knowledgeable about them, and definitely manipulating them (which is what was implied to be happening in the lab) would be beyond even the top biologists. In fact, one of the only people who is knowledgeable on the subject and is still alive by 9 ABY is palpatine himself. He’s probably too busy setting up the final order, regaining power and creating snoke to do jobs like what Gideon is doing, so I believe he has Gideon on the ground doing all the leg work for him. Before that, in episode 11, we see an imperial officer kill himself and his men with no hesitation because of pure fanaticism. But why would people be willing to kill themselves for basically a nobody. That’s because he knew who his real boss was. He didn’t kill him self for Gideon. But for sheev himself. He knew the emperor was still alive. 
Now, for the first order. There’s not much proof for this apart from the lack of back story to the first order.

Imagine Anakin and the 501st are destroying the temple, Shaak Ti knows that Grogu must be saved. She rushes him to a ship as Anakin and the 501st trail her.

760,1606670647.0,StarWarsTheories,"Who will Grogu meet when he reaches the Seeing Stone? ?? My guess is Yoda's force ghost. - Among the many possibilities: Luke, Mace, Cal, Ezra, or dark forces like Gideon, Thrawn, Snoke clone, some random dark Jedi etc.

My bet is Yoda's force ghost. Reasons being:

1. Cost:  Cheap and easy for Disney to make, just CGI, no need to hire other actors and easily fit into the plot.
2. Continuity:  Yoda is already dead so Grogu will stay with Mando so the ""Father and Son"" dual theme  and the "" Jedi and Mandalorian"" dual themes will remain in tact.
3. Happy Family:  Yoda will reveal he is indeed the father of Grogu so Grogu get to see his father again and Yoda personally giving Mando the blessing that Mando will be Grogu's adopted son. Thus Grogu will be both Jedi and Mandalorian just like  Tarre Vizsla. And Grogu will continue to be with Mando to fight as Mandalorian/Jedi dual. It is Disney, so happy family theme is good for the brand.
4. Pedigree and graduation:  Yoda, the Jedi master of high wisdom and statute will train Grogu, again, if not for the first time, just like Yoda trained Luke. Grogu's Jedi educational has high pedigree since Grogu's early years but it was incomplete due to Order 66. Now it is the time for Yoda to train Grogu so Grogu can graduate. Grogu being formally trained will only need a short training time with Yoda to become major badass. Yoda trained Luke, a complete novice  for 30+ min (screen time) to 6 months. So Yoda force ghost can give Grogu some advance lessons in an episode or two. And that is a TON more training than what Rey got."

When Obi-Wan, Anakin, and Ahsoka went to Mortis that could have easily created one of the species because of how much of the Force was being used.

That’s why she’s willing *at all* to train Grogu in the ways of the force, and how she knows of the Temple Mount and directs Mando and Grogu to head there.

Ok, so Grogu is 50 years old. Given that there is a gap of 30 years between Episode VII and VI, and Leia and Luke are 60 years old in Episode VII, they were 30 in Episode VI, therefore from the end of Episode III to the end of Episode VI, there are 30 years. And a gap of 15 years (we can see by Anakin's age) between Episodes II and III. Add in the 5 years between VI and Mandalorian, and we get 50 years between Attack of the Clones and Mandalorian (Grogu's age). Therefore Grogu was born in the Attack of the Clones.

If we remember that Yoda (even though it's not shown) went to the Clone Factory to get the clone army, we could postulate that Yoda asked for a clone of himself to be made, therefore not ending his specie's, and that clone is Grogu."

She sends Clan Mudhorn over to Tython, and tells Din to place Grogu on the ""seeing stone at the top of the mountain"". I think this ""seeing stone"" will be similar to the one Luke meditated on on Ach-To, as it is apparently meant to be a Force amplifier of sorts, and could be the reason for why Luke was able to use the Force to project an image of himself all the way to Crait.

Now, when Grogu reaches out, we are going to need a Jedi, who's familiar with the pull of the Dark Side, and is able to resist it or even balance the two. 

Ezra is a great example of this, and seems to be the option that a lot of people have gone for. He had the whole thing with almost falling to the dark side, but being able to resist it, and would thus make a potentially great teacher for Grogu. Here's the thing tho: Ahsoka might be getting her own spin-off series, where she will try to find Thrawn, and since Thrawn and Ezra were last seen together, I would bet that Ezra will be saved for that potential series.

I think that there is a potentially good chance that Cal Kestis will be the one to take Grogu as his padawan. Throughout the entire story of Jedi: Fallen Order, we see Cal struggle with the pull from the Dark Side, which is caused by his guilt and fear after losing his master in Order 66. This would line up perfectly with Grogu's fear of losing his father. The fact that the Nightsister Merrin is presumably still with him, means that they would also have first-hand knowledge from a strong user of the Dark Side.

Cere Junda tells Cal, that when Order 66 happened, she and then-padawan Trilla took several younglings and went into hiding. Could it be, that Grogu was one of those younglings?

And as a last thing. Cal's voice and motion capture actor, Cameron Monaghan, suddenly posted [a collage of Cal Kestis photos](https://www.instagram.com/p/CHpr7mWn77R/) onto his Instagram page just a week ago, out of the blue. It could also be hinting towards The Game Awards, which will be happening next month, with a potential announcement of a sequel game, but even if so, wouldn't this be a great way to build up hype for that game series? Cal would be about 35 during the time of The Mandalorian, and Cameron Monaghan is 27 years old, so it's not even that far off.

Edit: It could also be Luke or even Windu, but Luke should be off doing other stuff at this time, and Windu is presumably dead. However, it would be dope to see Windu come back somehow. It's just very unlikely."

We know of Yoda and Yaddle who apparently share this child's species, but we don't know that species name.  
....we're also all more than a little sketched-out at the idea of Yoda and Yaddle boning down...  

What if Star Wars has put the species name in front of us all along -- ""Yoda"". 
Perhaps, in his infinite wisdom, Master Yoda took the name of his species as his own and rose to the level of a galactic legend in the Jedi order as a way to honor and remember his people after they were wiped out / disappeared.  It would also serve to mask his whereabouts, should he ever need to run away and hide -- people with names are easy to find through the Force, it seems.  

Simply close your eyes, call out the name and you can connect. Well what if asking for ""yoda"" overwhelms the Force by asking it to help you find ALL yodas in the galaxy.  

You would probably get back a lot of noise and signs of death, right?? 

So maybe it isn't The Child's name we should be clamoring for or discussing, but the names of Masters Yoda and Yaddle. Simply put, saying ""yoda"" is like saying ""mankind/man"" and refers to the males of the species, and ""Yaddle"" refers to females. I suspect that upon arriving at the temple and meeting Yoda, Yaddle would be trained to lose and forget her old name and aid Yoda in the memorialization of their race, and in hiding herself should disaster strike. 

The Child's origin could be a result of Yoda and Yaddle not bumping uglies, but rather experimenting with immaculate conception and influencing Yaddle's pregnancy. They would then go on to name their child -- counter-intuitively -- as a way to mask his identity and connection with their species.  

The show has called him Baby Yoda this whole time because that's literally what he is. A baby, male yoda. 

Alternatively, the species could be the name that yoda and yaddle are derived from -- like Yoden, or Yodi, or Yoddla (the third also happening to be a combo of Yoda and Yaddle).  

An unlikely, ""stretch"" theory could be that Yoda's Species is so Force-adept, they automatically become Force ghosts when they die. Perhaps Yoda has been feeding on his peoples' expired Force energy for hundreds of years, ensuring he would be around to see the return of his people...

**TL;DR** - The males in Yoda's species are called 'yoda', the females are called 'yaddle'. The jedi we knew took these names to mask their identity in case they needed to exile, and to honor and memorialize their people.  

The Child was a result of Yoda and Yaddle experimenting with immaculate conception and will open the door to this idea for possible Rey/Kylo babies."

Like many at this sub I have some ideas/ speculations regarding the rest of season 2 of the Mandalorian.

Currently we know that Ashoka send the Mandalorian of, to place Grogu on the seeing stone of Tython. Which he will reach in the final.

In my mind one of the Snoke clones who are already in production will show up, dressed in Jedi robes and posing as one.

Since the clones all seem to be forcesensitive that clone could make the Mandalorian believe that he is a Jedi.

With a heavy heart the ManDADlorian gives his son away.

The Snoke clon leaves with the child.

Luke Skywalker (hopefully played by Sebastian Stan) shows up as the Mandalorian is about to leave Tython.

After some back and for the Mandalorian tells Luke what happend and Luke explains that he has been tricket.

Both of them take of together in search for Gorgu and the Snoke clon.

S3 will than revolve around finding them, while both of them try to rebuild their respective cultures (Jedi and Mandalorian).

Could that be or are those just my hopeful thoughts?

What do you think?"
771,1606586444.0,StarWarsTheories,"A theory about the creation/origin of the Dark Saber - So after watch the last episode of The Mandalorian in which it is revealed that Beskar can withstand a lightsaber blade I had two theories about the material and its relation to the Dark Saber. Both theories are similar but have some key distinctions.

We know that the Dark Saber is a unique lightsaber created by the first and (only?) Mandalorian inducted into the Jedi Order. While it's never explicitly stated I believe the hilt of the Dark Saber is made of Beskar which is part of what gives it it's unique properties. 

As for its creation I have two thoughts. The first is a hilt made of Beskar that when combined with a Kyber crystal gives it it's signature look. The second has more or a history.

My second theory is that originally the Dark Saber was a Beskar sword that may have been an heirloom or had some sort of great importance to the man who eventually made the dark saber. When he built his lightsaber he took this blade, rebuilt the hilt and added the crystal and this created some sort of reaction that fused the original Beskar blade with the crystal. This would explain the shape of the blade as well as the color.

Anyway just my crazy idea. Let me know what y'all think!"
772,1606543109.0,StarWarsTheories,"Mandalore, The First and Final Order, Snoke, Rebels, and Grand Admiral Thrawn - I found myself wondering about how Dave Filoni is approaching the live action shows at Lucasfilm, and what overarching principles he and the show-runners use when deciding how to approach the story of The Mandolorian.

Here’s the basic principles I’d argue he used in the past work on Clone Wars and Rebels:

1. Focus on building out the universe in detailed and cannon consistent ways.
2. Character build know and unknown characters by focusing on their “arcs”
3. Gap fill material between the movies in order to create more logical motivations and understood stakes in the movies.

I believe Filoni has done all of these masterfully in both animated shows he worked on prior to Mando, and the Star Wars universe is better off because of it. The prequels are more palatable and much more grounded in stakes that are real and understood because of the Clone Wars. The buildup to Rogue One and a New Hope is more clear and the desperate situation of the galaxy more communicated because of Rebels. And his additions in both shows are some of the clearest and most engaging entries into cannon.

Like and creative at the peak of their powers, I believe Filoni is looking to execute on these same principles on The Mandolorian, but at a much higher difficulty level. I think he’s trying to tell the story between ROTJ and the sequel trilogy while also tying up all the loose ends of the stories he’s told before.

I believe his goals now are:

1. Fully flesh out his obsession with the Mandolorians, by showing us how the planet and the people have been pushed to the edge of extinction despite their deep and rich history, only to prevail to reclaim their planet, take back the dark saber, unify all the factions (the children of the watch, etc.) and restore the Mandolorian way of life.

2. Explain how the imperial remnant became the first order and the final order. We will see how Moff Gideon, Snoke, and Palpatine all fit into the endgame more clearly. I believe we will see the gutting of illum, Exogol, and the construction of The Supremacy and other first order super stations, and the final order fleet. I believe central to all these plans for super ships and battle stations is Grand Admiral Thrawn, as he still has material sourcers  in his chain of command.

3. Finish the stories of Ezra, Sabine, Zeb, and Ahsoka Tano. I hope he will do so in a spin-off, and I believe much of the story will take place in the unknown regions.

4. I also believe Filoni is setting up Gorgu to be a Jedi trained by the Jedi (I’d wager Luke at some point), but also trained by Mando. I believe that Gorgu will become a Mandorian Jedi, come to wield the dark saber, and is destined to be apart of the fulfillment of the restoration of Mandalore as an echo of Tarre Vizsla.

These are the things I think driving Filoni. Could be wrong, but this is my take.

I also think at this point, it’d be dumb for Disney not to give this guy a movie or a trilogy. At least someday."
773,1606542641.0,StarWarsTheories,"[The Mandalorian] The Final Three Episodes - # WARNING: SPOILER ALERT for most of the episodes of The Mandalorian

So, the latest episode of the Mandalorian most likely has set up the final three episodes of the show, Chapter 14, 15, and 16.  With Mando and the newly named Baby Yoda ""Grogu"" must go to the planet of Tython to a Jedi temple, where Grogu will reach out with the Force, and find a Jedi to train him. So, this got the gears in my head turning on how the next episodes will play out, as I am *very excited* to see how the final will play out, as I'm sure a lot of you are. 

**Episode 14**

I don't want to go too in-depth for this episode, as I believe it will be another filler episode. Mando and Grogu stop by a different planet on their way to Tython, where someone asks them to do a thing in exchange for something Mando wants. He helps the person(s) with the thing, and the person(s) give Mando what he wants. Mando then goes off to continue the main plot, just like most of the episodes this season.

**Episode 15**

This is where it gets BIG. So, the episode begins with Mando and Grogu flying through the dangerous path to Tython, and they crash land on the icy planet, the Razor Crest getting damaged quite a bit. Mando grabs Grogu and starts on their journey to try and find this Jedi temple. 

On Moff Gideon's ship, he and his other crew members are setting off to Tython to get Grogu, and he says that it is finally time to release his new ""allies"". He goes to that one chamber room he was in at the end of Chapter 12, and he presses a couple buttons, releasing the **Dark Troopers** from their cells. The Empire has been using Grogu's blood to genetically make these Force-sensitive battle soldiers, with guns attached to their limbs and stuff like that.

Back on Tython, Mando and Grogu finally reach the Jedi temple, but in order to enter, you must have access to the Force, and do some sort of Force challenge. Grogu seems to sense what's going on, so he uses the Force to complete the challenge, and they're able to enter the temple. They walk through the temple, Grogu seeming a bit uneasy with the amount of Force coming out of this place. They reach that one stone Ashoka Tano was talking about in Chapter 13, and Mando encourages Grogu to reach out with the Force to find more Jedi, though Grogu doesn't want to. But, he reluctantly reaches out, trying to communicate with other Jedi through the Force.

Suddenly, the Dark Troopers storm the temple, holding Mando at gunpoint. Grogu tries to defend Mando, but he's outmatched. The Dark Troopers take Mando and Grogu back to the ship, and Mando is held in a prison cell while Grogu is taken to get his blood extracted.

**Episode 16**

The episode begins with imperial scientists extracting some blood from Grogu, with Grogu waking up, and using his anger and fear to create a giant Force blast, killing a lot of the scientists and breaking him free from his containment cell. 

Now that Grogu is free, he sneaks around the imperial base, trying to find Mando to break him free (maybe he force chokes some Stormtroopers, idk). After a bit of waddling about, he finds Mando in his cell, and helps him break out. Since Mando doesn't have his weapons, he needs to get them back, so he and Grogu sneak around, taking out Stormtroopers using melee combat. Mando gets all of his weapons back, and he gets outta there.

With the new blood they got from Grogu, the Empire can make more Dark Troopers, making an even bigger army.  As Mando is running away to a ship in the distance, the army of Dark Troopers and Moff Gideon block his path, and the Dark Troopers are about to kill him, when a fleet of New Republic ships fly overhead, firing at the army. Even Cara Dune is there, having joined the New Republic, and so is Greef Karga, having been requested by Cara for back-up. 

A large fight breaks out, with the New Republic, Greef Karga, and the Mythrol fighting the Dark Troopers, while Mando fights Gideon, with Mando using his Beskar Spear, and Gideon using the Darksaber. After a big fight with a lot of awesome moments, Gideon is struck down and killed by Mando, and the Dark Troopers are destroyed. Mando catches up with Cara and Greef, but he has to go, and leaves on an Empire ship. On his way to Tython, he takes a detour and gives the Darksaber back to Bo Katan, so she can go back to ruling Mandalore.

Mando and Grogu head back to Tython and the Jedi temple, where none other than **Luke Skywalker** and his droid companion R2-D2 are waiting for them. Mando briefly explains the situation, and Luke Skywalker agrees to train Grogu. Mando gives one last goodbye to Grogu, and he sends him off with Luke, going back to the Razor Crest, and continuing his bounty hunter adventures in The Mandalorian Season 3."

777,1606499731.0,StarWarsTheories,"The Child origins - Spoilers for today's Mandalorian episode (The Jedi) will follow.

In the episode that aired today, Ahsoka Tano communes with The Child through the Force and learns about his early life. Evidently, The Child was present at the Jedi Temple through the entirety of the Clone Wars, and trained there under several Masters. Phantom Menace to The Mandalorian is roughly 40 years of The Child's 50-year life, so we can assume he had resided there for most, if not all, of his life beforehand if he had time to train under ""several Masters"". The Jedi Temple, funnily enough, also contained two adult members of Yoda's Species during that time.

The Jedi Council allows individuals whose species possess low birthrates, such as Cereans, to procreate. Suppose Yoda's Species has a similar exception. The only place in the Galaxy where the species has been observed in groups of more than one is at the Jedi Temple during the last years of the Old Republic, with Yoda being Grand Master and The Child living somewhere therein. Yaddle, a female member of the Species, died between Phantom Menace and AotC, but had been there long enough to train many Padawans and sit on the High Council.

Yoda's Species has been observed to age at a strange rate, and live exceptionally long. Yaddle's age is unknown, but her hair retained pigment, perhaps indicating she was much younger than Yoda. Knowing this, and that we know absolutely nothing about fertility in the Species, it's entirely possible (likely, even) that The Child is the offspring of Yaddle and Yoda, born about ten years prior to Phantom Menace and raised in the Temple. This theory has been posited before, but we now have concrete evidence that The Child did inhabit the Jedi Temple for most of his life.

It's worth noting that Ahsoka Tano states that many Masters trained The Child, but the existence of another member of Yoda's Species in the Temple after the demise of Yaddle seems a secret to basically everybody. Perhaps his training was reserved for high ranking Councilmen, who were sworn to secrecy by Yoda due to the vulnerable state that the species exists in for the early century of its life. A likely candidate for one of these Masters, in my opinion, would be Plo Koon. Plo possesses a gentle touch, skill with the Force, and retained a Council position from TPM to RotS. The Child is about ten in TPM, and would be around 23 by RotS. It's entirely likely that The Child reached sufficient mental maturity to train in the Force during this period, and that Plo Koon was privy to that knowledge and seen by Yoda as a candidate for training. This would have had to been during the ten years between TPM and AotC, as Plo spent the last three years of his life on the front lines. Training could've then passed on to one of the Council members at home, perhaps even Yoda himself as one of The Child's trainers."

779,1606457828.0,StarWarsTheories,"[The Mandalorian Season 2 Episode 5] Who is this ""Jedi"" the title is talking about? - **WARNING- SPOILER WARNING for The Mandalorian, The Clone Wars, and Rebels**

&#x200B;

So, it's almost confirmed that  Ashoka Tano will appear in the Mandalorian Season 2, Episode 5, which is titled ""The Jedi"". But,  Ashoka isn't a Jedi. Dave Faloni, the director, knows this, and Jon Favreau, the writer, knows this. Ashoka left the Jedi Order at the end of The Clone Wars Season 5, and she never rejoined it afterwards. In Season 7, she did get two blue lightsabers, but Mace Windu still refers to her as ""citizen"", referencing that she's still not a Jedi. Heck, even Captain Rex says so! So, something tells me another Jedi will appear or will be mentioned by Ashoka in this episode. But, who is it?

**Luke Skywalker**

Luke Skywalker is heavily rumored to be featured in The Mandalorian, maybe played by Sebastian Stan. It's possible that after Return of the Jedi, Luke tried to locate other Jedi and Force users, and found Ashoka. I think the two might have bonded over their connection with Anakin Skywalker, but they parted ways, as Ashoka wanted nothing to do with making a new Jedi order. I think this is heavily possible, but we should also look for other possible Jedi.

**Ezra Bridger**

This one is also quite likely and rumored.  At the end of Rebels and after the events of Return of the Jedi, Sabine Wren located Ashoka, and the two set off to look for Ezra Bridger, who disappeared with Thrawn in the finale. I don't think Sabine will appear in this episode, maybe she and Ashoka's trail went cold and they parted ways, or they decided to split up to cover more ground at once, but I think it's possible that Mando will help Ashoka find Ezra, and he might show up by the end of the episode.

**Mace Windu**

This one, while rumored for other things, is not heavily rumored for The Mandalorian. Samuel L. Jackson has said that he really wants to return as Mace Windu, and has also said that it's possible Mace is still alive, as Jedi can fall from great heights. This one I think is the least likely, though, as there has been no evidence so far, and Mace and Ashoka don't have a very... *friendly* connection, so I don't know why Ashoka would be connected to him in any way.

**Conclusion**

So, those are the three possible Jedi I think could be the one the title is referring to. So, who do I think it will be? Honestly, I think it will be Luke.  Something tells me they might make a show about Ashoka and Sabine finding Ezra, and having Luke in The Mandalorian could be a big marketing factor in Disney's eyes. But, I guess we'll just have to wait and see."
780,1606360089.0,StarWarsTheories,"Mando is force sensitive and will train as a Jedi in season 3? Possibly related to a big Mandalorian figure? - I don't really have a well thought out theory for this and I'm sure it's been elaborated on in this sub plenty of times. But it's kind of curious that Mando seems to 'sense' things. For example, in the most recent episode, he noticed Koska Reeves watching him from afar amongst a bustling crowd and he grabbed that creature before it got to baby yoda without even looking. There are probably way more examples I'm missing within the show.

With them meeting up with Ahsoka next episode, perhaps she will sense the force within him and make him aware of it? We know this journey is for the child, but this could be a great way to weave Mando tighter to his narrative which would make them inseparable for the series length. They could both learn under Ahsoka in the ways of the Jedi and it would be a total mind blowing moment if we see Mando crafting his own lightsaber at the end of season 2!

Also another possible scenario crossed my mind, though far fetched. With all this darksaber business, It would be an even bigger bomb drop if we found out that Mando is the descendant of Tarre Vizsla; the first Mandalorian Jedi. And that maybe possibly that is why the Death Watch we're actively *seeking* him out instead of just happening upon him. This would also explain his force sensitivity AND it would mean he is the rightful heir to the Darksaber. The stakes would be raised even higher to obtain it from Gideon! 

What are your guy's thoughts on this?"
781,1606418239.0,StarWarsTheories,"Yoda's race is not called the ""Jedi"", and further expanding on the etymology of the word. - Jedi is derived from the ancient Sith title ""Je'daii"". They were an order of Force users from the original Sith race. I'm a bit late seeing that post, but no, Jedi is not the name of Yoda's race. Sith as a word did not change spelling-wise.

They just began to call themselves the Sith Lords, and that only-partial name change could probably be attributed to the fact that the original Sith Lords were half-breeds of Sith and Humans.

On the other hand, the distinct Jedi Order was not started by half-breeds. I believe the change from Je'daii to Jedi was not just a thing of language changing over time, but it was intentionally altered so the Jedi could hide the fact that the Jedi Order has the same origin as the Sith Lords."

If the soldiers Gideon was overseeing at the end of the last episode were in fact Dark Troopers, who are Force-sensitive soldiers, then that would explain why Gideon wants the child. Yoda's race is clearly Force sensitive, apparently so much so that an infant can utilize the Force intentionally, and smart ehough to use it to do specific things. So the reason they were draining the child's blood is to transplant it to them, building an army of Force sensitive Stormtroopers/Dark Troopers. Idk if this is inspired by the Sith or potentially having to do with them. And with the Darksaber being in use, I'm hoping Darth Maul is the secret big bad to lead a new Empire."
783,1606381889.0,StarWarsTheories,"Mando S2E5 Theory - Up until this point there have been striking similarities between the corresponding episodes of seasons 1 and 2 (i.e S1E1 vs. S2E1), thanks to another user for pointing this out 3 weeks back. Season 1 Episode 5 was directed by Filoni. This was the episode where Mando lands on Tatooine and leaves the Child with the engineer lady to find more information in Mos Eisley regarding the Child and the Doctor. If you want the full summary just pull it up on Google, for sake of writing I will try and keep this theory short. At the end of the Episode a shadowed figure appears to claim the bounty of Fennec (assassin in this episode) who was dead earlier upon Mando’s second arrival. It seems this person is Boba, not 100% obviously, but given it is Tatooine and we recently saw Boba in S2E1 it basically confirms it. To get to the point, this new episode is very very likely to follow the trend it has been on as of late. Instead of meeting the engineer woman early in the episode I think he will meet an undercover Ahsoka who immediately recognize him and the Child from her contact with Bo Katan but attempts to keep a low profile given she knows how valuable and powerful the Child is. From here she will take them to a sort of refuge, maybe village on this so called forest planet Corvus, which I envision to be very similar in nature to Endor or maybe even Naboo. There will be a native species that Ahsoka has communicated with and lived with for some time that take great interest in the Child (I highly doubt it but maybe Filoni has the balls to be like “George gave me the all clear, this is the Yoda species home planet”😂) and the two Jedi’ force sensitivity. After some much needed backstory around the campfire from Ahsoka, the three will enjoy some quality relaxation and go to sleep. Mando will awake during the night to the movements coming from his outside house for the night and come face to face with some of Gideons stormtroopers but no Gideon himself. Mando will sneak away and attempt to protect the Child and alert Ahsoka but he finds them to be disappeared, they are off meditating in nature somewhere attempting to grasp the Childs knowledge of the force up to this point (Mando still doesnt understand the Jedi at this point). With the help of the native species of Corvus, Mando eliminates the stormtrooper force but is still frantic to find the Child and Ahsoka. He will run into the forest to look for them and find them surrounded by a squadron of gideons new Super Troopers and Gideon chilling in a TIE of Imperial Shuttle. Keeping a low profile and with the aid of the native species he is able to distract the Troopers with his jetpack and allow Ahsoka to escape with the Child. In a fight that leaves a majority of the new species dead and Mando himself greatly injured he will again attempt to find the Child and Ahsoka, and while stumbling through the forest he hears screaming and vibrations coming from the earth. As he gets closer he sees Moff Gideon flying away and becomes terrified. Closer and closer he gets and he is met with a bright flash of white. Illuminated in the glow is Ahsoka with her sabers ignited and the Child creating a force field around them without absolutely draining his powers. Ahsoka will have an action packed fight sequence credit of Filoni and eventually she will overwhelmed and the Child will faint, but Mando uses the last of his targeting missiles to defeat the last of the Super Troopers before they can defeat Ahsoka. The three return to the village they were staying at and sleep through the night, and in the morning they board the repaired Razor Crest (credit to the native species for being mechanics) and fly off to a planet where Ahsoka knows they can find another Jedi that is truly capable of teaching him since she is technically not a member of the order anymore. Ending scene: Boba Fett walks throught the forest of Corvus and finds the remains of the new Super Troopers. He is donning his classic armor again after killing Cobb Vanth or freezing him in Carbonite (I think this is likely because he is very Han Solo esque). End of episode. 
I said I was gonna keep it short lol. 

Now, obviously my theory may not directly replicate the plot of S1E5 but there are a few key plot elements from each episode that are recycled for the next season.

1. - Landing on Corvus with intention of finding Ahsoka but the immediate need is repairs, Ahsoka is mingling in the shadows and senses the childs force and takes a great interest in the Child. 
   S1: Mando lands on Tatooine and gets repairs from the engineer lady who takes an interest in the Child

2. - Mando wants to find more information about the Child and the Jedi, but Ahsoka insists they get to a safer location. 
   S1: Mando enters a cantina with the intention of finding information about the Child but meets a bounty hunter instead.

3. Mando gets so close to killing Moff Gideon but he speeds away once he knows there are Jedi at play. 
   S1: Mando gets played by the bounty hunter: they defeat the assassin on Tatooine, he leaves to go do something, comes back to find the assassin dead and no bounty hunter friend, and then returns to the shipyard to find the engineer and Child held hostage by the bounty hunter.

4. Boba Fett appears in full armor and exits Slave One.
 S1: Boba Fett makes his appearance noted with his notorious clanking sound replicated from the classic films.

784,1606343939.0,StarWarsTheories,"The Mandalorian Season 2 Episode 5 BIG Theory/Prediction -  We know that the next mandalorian episode will be entitled 'the jedi' and is directed by Dave Filoni.

Given all the previous rumors, it is pretty much a given that we are going to see a live action Ahsoka in less than 2 days.

Baby Yoda has been a background character so far in the series and has seen little to no character development. Plus we know very little about him (or her?).

I think this is about to change starting with the next episode but with that being said, Din Djarin will remain the main focus of the series.

If some of you would prefer to listen to me rather than read, feel free to check out this video (if you can stand my voice that is): [https://youtu.be/2wvml3n46b8](https://youtu.be/2wvml3n46b8)

Given Ahsoka's relationship with Yoda, she will clearly recognize the child as a member of the same species. This raises the question if the characters in Star Wars know something about the mysterious race. This was never addressed before but that does not mean that noone knows anything about yoda's species.

For all we know, perhaps the jedi and Ahsoka knew something all along but simply did not mention it.

I think in the very next episode we might actually get to find out more about Yoda's species for the very first time. They will not reveal much and still some stuff be left as a mystery box, open to interpretation but they will reveal something.

Which brings me to my theory.

I think that mebmers of Yoda's species are created by the will of the force whenever the need arises.

Kreia, a fan favourite character from Knights of the Old Republic 2

had a dialogue line in that game in which she said that force seems to have a will of its own, attempting to bring balance no matter the cost. A somewhat similar notion was explored in 6th season of The Clone Wars in the Yoda episodes.

In these episodes Yoda communed with Force Priestessess that many think are somehow related to the whills or even might an iteration of what geroge lucas envisioned the whills to be.

Indeed, the concept of whills came directly from george and dates back to the very first script of original Star Wars. Whills are supposed to be THESE mysterious beings that take great interest in other beings that are strong in the force. They were basically supposed to be the narrators of the Skywalker saga. This also alligns with a specific dialogue line of one of the Force Priessteeses from the Clone Wars.

Keep in mind that Lucasfilm was always careful about explaining too much about the force and they will probaly keep on being vague. Certain details might lack logic but that is fine. This is all intended so fans can interpret some things as they choose.

I think that whenever the force is out of balance, a new meber of the yoda species is born to shift the tide.

Baby Yoda was born 41 years before battle for yavin much like Anakin Skywalker, the chosen one.

What if he was meant to be a contigency plan of sorts, if Anakin failed to bring about the balance. Or perhaps the dark side grew so powerful after Sidious was born and became a sith that two powerful light side beings were given birh instead of just one. Might also be that the force was aware that Anakin would fall to the dark side and his eventual redemption was never a certaintity.

Could be that Sidious was so powerful that he was actually opposing the will of the force, bending it to his will. Possibilities here are endless and I am curious what the creatives involved will explore.

Yoda was born 896 years before battle for yavin. All we know about Darth Bane in canon is that he died approximately a milennium before the clone wars. Maybe if they every choose to reintroduce that character into canon in some way, his raise to power will corellate with Yoda's birth which would also support my theory.

Yaddle was born 509 years before battle for yavin and no significant events that we know of took place at that time but this does not contradict my theory and future stories might delve deeper into the character of yaddle and that time if my theory proves correct. Yaddle started out as a background character in

Phantom Menace probably because Geroge liked the idea of having a female counterpart of Yoda. The creative freedom is there to explore and with Baby Yoda introduced

I think we will find out more about Yaddle eventually.

It is also possible that Ahsoka will realize how dangerous the child potentially is and in what danger it is because of that. Many would probably like to exploit its power, not just the empire, the sith, Palpatine or something else entirely but future jedi as well. Big part of Ahsoka's story arc is that she realized how flawed the jedi were and even though she left the order, she was actually more of a jedi than the jedi themselves were. Perhaps she will advise Din Djarin to keep the child hidden from everyone.

Regardless, I am still convinced that she will only be present in the series for an episode or two and then will be forced to leave. She is not going to take the child away from mando, no way that happens.

Oh and one more thing. I think we might hear her actually say 'Baby Yoda' in the show, as a nod to the fans. It would make sense.

What do you guys think about this theory that members of the yoda species are brought about by the will of the force? Do you think I am onto something?"
785,1606203533.0,StarWarsTheories,"Rebels, the morality of the Jedi. - So in rebels, what I've noticed is that most of the time Kanan and Ezra don't directly kill storm troopers. Often they just cut their blasters in half and then kick them or something. 

Here is the problem, this is a kids show and the characters don't directly kill. But lets take the Mandalore episode where they fight on top of this transport, they cut up the storm troopers blasters, then kick them off the transport into the desert. So now the storm troopers could die of starvation or heatstroke which would be a way more painful and pitiful way of dying. So why don't they just give them a proper (warrior's) death (less painful) if they are going to die anyway, wouldn't that be more morally correct?

Noone in clone wars shows this hesitation though, which I find pretty satisfying."

787,1606159966.0,StarWarsTheories,"I know this might seem obvious (to an extent) but we still DON'T KNOW SO MUCH about Ahsoka Tano plus... - ...the fact that she was mentioned in mando raises so many questions...

This post is a summary of all these major things that we do not know about Ahsoka, the story gaps. I share my theories but if mods deem it as not worthy for the sub, I totally understand. I apologize if that is the case!

If some of you prefer to listen rather than read (if you don't mind my voice that is), feel free to check out this video: [https://youtu.be/1BGVcLRPh7M](https://youtu.be/1BGVcLRPh7M)

**1.** We do not know what Ahsoka did after the events seen in the Star Wars: Rebeles episode entitled World Between Worlds. After season 2 finale of Rebels aired and Ahsoka supposedly died, many still speculated that she survived the encounter with Vader. How exactly they parted ways remained a mystery for approximately 2 years. All we knew after seeing Twilight of the Apprentice is that she walked down some stairs om Malachor, the shot was very reminscent of one from the season 5 finale of The Clone Wars in which she chooes to leave the jedi behind. 

Some time after the finale aired, Topps released cards with art drawn by none other than Dave Filoni. On the said card with very ambigous drawings Ahsoka descended further into the temple. 

We don't know if Dave Filoni had the entire story arc planned out from the start and through how much iterative work it went through but I suspect some things changed during the development process as is often the case with such creative work. 

In Worlds between Worlds it was revealed that Ezra saves Ahsoka by using the power of a mysterious temple that somehow controls time and space. The entire arc is still shrouded in mystery and I doubt we'll be seeing more of it anytime soon which is a good thing since time travel has no place in Star Wars. Still, I absolutely loved how they handeled it in Rebels as a one time thing. 

Ahsoka goes back in time in that episode, she is savy enough to realize that she can't go with Ezra and instead needs to return to her own timeline.

Next time we see her she appears at the end of Rebels, some time after the Battle of Endor. 

**What she was doing during the original trilogy remains a mystery. Was she at Malachor all this time or left at some point?** I do believe there is some story there to be told and we will definitely find out more one day.

**2.** Her time as Fulcrum, a rebel agent. 

Obviously we found out more about that side of her in Rebels plus the Ahsoka novel had a scene with her and Bail Organa (even young Leia was present though Ahsoka never interacted with her directly, at least as far as we know). Ahsoka wanted to recruit people to join up with the rebellion rather than fight herself, she was tired of fighting after the clone wars. 

**I  think there are still some stories left to be told showcasing her involvement in the formation of rebel cells across the galaxy. Some people speculate that we might see her in the upcoming Kenobi series. I am not sure if she has a place in that story but if Vader will be present in it, she might.**

**3.** What she did after the events of Victory and Death, The Clone wars finale. 

Rebel Alliance was formed some time after Revenge of the Sith and Clone Wars finale, much closer to the events of original trilogy and the galactic civil war. 

Even rebells cells were not formed that quickly. We don't know what Ahsoka did initially after the formation of the galactic empire. Did she stay with Rex or did they go their separate ways, hiding from the empire? I do believe we will get some answers to this in the Bad Batch Series.

Rebels did reveal that at some point they did go their separate ways and Rex have not heard from Ahsoka for some time. I do belive the narrative was written in such a manner to elevate the emotional impact of their eventual reunion.

**4.** Ahsoka's relationship with Original Trilogy characters such as Luke Skywalker. 

Since we now know that Ahsoka was alive and well after the Battle of Endor, this immidately raises the question: **Does  she know Luke Skywalker?**

The Secrets of the Jedi novel which is supposedly written from Luke's point of view shares some information on Ahsoka which in turn suggests that he was aware of her existence at some point.

This book should be taken with a grain of salt but personally I think it is only a matter of time utnil we get a story involving Luke and Ahsoka. So much potential there that creatives are bound to explore.

Stars need to allign just right though and we have be patient. Perhaps the moment will arrive sooner than we expect it to given The Mandalorian.

**5.** Ahsoka's time after leaving the jedi order. 

We got a good glimpse at what she was up to during that time in the final season of the clone wars and I suppose I'd be fine with it if they never explored this again but still, I thought it was worth a mention.

I think we still might bet some stories with her during that time, perhaps in a different format, a comic book or a novel.

**6.** Ahsoka at the time of the Mandalorian.

I think this is what most people are excited about and we will find out more VERY soon. 

This might somehow tie in to her time after Rebels. The big question is if the Mandalorian happens before the ending of Rebels or after. I am guessing AFTER but it was not confirmed. Also, we have no clue if Ahsoka is still looking for Ezra in the Unknown Regions or already found him.

Which brings me to number **7:** Ahsoka's quest to find Ezra Bridger. 

We know that Ahsoka travled with Sabine into the unknown regions to look for Ezra. This entire story arc will probably be resolved in the Rebels sequel, whatever it may be and also include Thrawn and possibly Grysk.

I believe they act as the new Yuuzhan Vong of canon but are rather different than their legends counterparts. 

**The Mandalorian might provide answers we seek but I don't think the show will focus on that narrative.** My guess is that Ahsoka will appear for an episode, two at most and then go on to do her own thing which we will find out more about in the future. The Mystery Box continues.

**8.** Is Ahsoka alive at the time of Rise of Skywalker?

Since Ashley Eckstein can be heared in Rise of Skywalker, one would think Ahsoka is dead since all the other jedi that can be heared are dead as well. I do belive that Dave Filoni teased she is not necessairly dead.

Rise of Skywalker occurs 35 years after the battle for yavin and Ahsoka was born 36 years before Battle for yavin which means she'd be 71 in the final movie of Skywalker Saga.

I'd like to point out that her being this grand wise sage figure sort of diminishes Luke's role after Return of the Jedi. UNLESS she will be alive and well in a completely different part of the galaxy, doing her own thing. 

**Here is my take on this: At this point, Lucasfilm and Dave Filoni don't know themselves if she is dead. They might have some vague ideas on where they want the character to go in the future but it all comes down to other stories they plan on telling.** We might get a show few years down the line with her and Luke. As they write the story for it and figure that Ahsoka should die, they might do just that. Otherwise, she might live.

We will just have to wait and see, these things change all the time and are iterated upon, such is the nature of creative work.

 I am curious what you all think about this big mystery box that Ahsoka seems to have attached to her. Which of these stories you feel will DEFINITELY be explored further in the future?"
788,1606098973.0,StarWarsTheories,"Was Plagueis supposed to live pre-disney? - In Republic Commando there is a cheat code named ""TheMatulaakLives"" and has always intrigued me, because what the hell is a Matulaak? This has bothered me since I was a kid, because I feel like it has some sort of meaning behind it. Recently I've tried to investigate.  


When googling ""Matulaak"" very few links show up, but one that stands out is the link to Darth Plagueis' Wookiepedia. After multiple read-throughs, I can't find anything that mentions the Matulaak. Considering the cheat code name and the very very slight implication of Plagueis being Matulaak, could this be a hint that Plagueis was supposed to live pre-disney?  


Unfortunately I don't have access to the Plagueis comics and I've dug through lots of links in hopes of finding some sort of mention to Matulaak to no avail. I could really use some help on this and at least be happy that Plagueis had some hope of being alive and becoming the greatest Sith lord in the galaxy."
789,1606074729.0,StarWarsTheories,"Legends Mandalorians possible retcon? - My theory is that the legends Mandalorians and Republic Commandos we know and love will be made canon as the Concordians. The likes of the Nulls and Commando squads that were trained by Kal Skirata and Walon Vau would come from Concordia instead of Mandalor proper, yet would still identify as Mandalorians. Death watch was not the entire population of Concordia and though they had been stationed there would not be the vast majority of the traditonal mandalorians.
Concordia in the Clone Wars Tv show has vast similarities to the legends Mandalor and the captial could be Kyrimorut.

1. Mace windu is one of the Jedi who from the beginning didn’t want Anakin trained.
2. In the clone wars Mace is pretty much the main reason Ahsoka is expelled from the Jedi order with the reason the republic might be offended.
3. Once ahsokas trial is over he just yeah I think this was all for the best this has brought you out as a stronger Jedi and crap.
4. Mace offended and made anakin mad by letting him  on the council but not giving him rank of master.
5. If mace wasn’t around when anakin finally turns to the dark side during mace and Palpatines fight anakins choice wouldn’t be between the man who has acted like he didn’t like anakin and thought him dangerous and the chancellor who has supported him and made him feel like a real hero, making anakins decision most likely more difficult perhaps he wouldn’t have chosen Palpatine if yoda or obi wan was in the place of mace or if ahsoka was with him and she’s not because of mace.

This symbolizes to us that someone important might die on Corvus. It would fit if Ashoka was the one to die, since Baby Yoda is so beloved, there needs to be a reason for Ashoka NOT to take Baby Yoda and raise him as a Jedi. The last appearance of Ashoka was in Star Wars Rebels, “World Between Worlds” significantly before Mandalorian, meaning there is no canonical guarantee she will survive."

795,1605908544.0,StarWarsTheories,"Fall of Kamino - Now as far as I know there is no canon explanation of what happened to Kamino after order 66. But what I am presenting is not a theory, as there is no proof for it. 

What I have come up with is a scenario after the end of the clone wars during the transition to the empire. In this scenario, a few vengeful CIS tactical droids (super or normal) remain. This group's strategies would no longer be weighed down by the meddling of upper generals, Dooku, or Palpatine. **Contrarily**, the group would be emboldened by the fall of the CIS and would have the desire to make a ***final*** ***grand*** ***effort***.

 Naturally, they would want to go after somewhere that would hit hard, but also somewhere they might have a chance. Kamino, after the win of the clone wars, would be less protected as the threat of the CIS is presumed to be neutralized, and clones not in as much need. Recognizing this weakness, the droids would acquire a small number of ships, a sizeable group of aqua droids, and a cache of **heavy** explosives. The droids could acquire these assets by making them or using what remains of the CIS. 

This insurgent group would then launch an assault on Kamino, possibly using the same strategy to get onto Kamino as the one seen previously. Instead of trying to preserve a dna sample, the aqua droids would plant explosives on the stilts of Kamino, while the ships and possibly ground troops provided a necessary distraction. Once ample charges were planted, they would have been detonated, which would create a chain reaction of Kamino's buildings falling.

This ultimately, would not have caused too much of a difference, but would provide an explanation of the lack of clones and of Kamino's fate.

796,1605894796.0,StarWarsTheories,"Isn’t Rey technically part solo? - Now this might be posted many times before this but I wouldn’t know because I just joined. Now I think Rey is a solo, why? You see, depending on if how Leia and Luke connect with each other through the whole saga is because they are brother and sister, well for this theory to make sense that’s what I’m going to go with here. As we see many times in the last Jedi, Rey and kylo are connecting almost like how Luke and Leia are connecting, which means they MUST be brother and sister, also we get told in the last Jedi that Rey’s “parents” are leaving her on Jakku because they are hiding her from Palpatine, now this can’t be her real parents, it must be some people who picked her up and kinda not really, raised her. And Ben, (aka Kylo Ren) is a solo, and then Rey must be a solo.

797,1605870441.0,StarWarsTheories,"Theory About The End/Near End of Chapter 12 of The Mandalorian (Spoilers) - So I made a great decision not to sleep and to instead watch Chapter 12, and with my 6am brain being in gear right now, I've been thinking.

It's made obvious in Chapter 12 at the Imperial laboratory that The Child's blood is very important to the ""New Era"" of the Empire. In addition to this, we can see a row of tanks holding clones/test subjects or something of the like. I've built two theories from this, one of which I more strongly support than the other.

My first theory is that these are early test runs of Snoke. It's made evident in the Sequel trilogy that Snoke is not unique, and perhaps the Empire wants to use The Child's blood to create a Force sensitive being. Dr. Pershing says in the hologram recording that is played, that the are unlikely to find a donor with a higher ""M Count"". Queue flashbacks to Qui-Gon and Anakin on Tatooine. While there isn't much more to dissect than the face value of this, I think it's fairly interesting and makes it more obvious the Empire is toying with the Force and Force sensitives.

My second theory, and the one that I think to be a better fit, is that, with this being only 5 years after the ""death"" of Palpatine and the destruction of the second Death Star, the remnants of the Empire have discovered Palpatine alive and not so well, and are trying to harness the healing powers of the Force to heal him. The Child has a strong connection with the Force and its healing abilities have even been showcased already, perhaps eluding to the Empire's desire and use for The Child. Sure, bacta tanks are used often throughout the Star Wars universe, but the idea of ""growing"" a Force sensitive being seems to fit into the idea of Snoke or a reborn/rejuvenated Palpatine.

Ironically, I hope that neither of these theories prove themselves to be true, as either one lends itself to  Kennedy's trilogy, and her rumored desire to use the series to essentially justify all of the terrible plot holes/drum-ups in episodes 7-9. I doubt Filoni would follow such a path in the story but who knows?"

He already flirted with the dark side and one could argue that being electrocuted would have been that little push that sent him over the edge (no pun intended).

 Obviously it's unlikely since there's no way in hell, no matter how in the dark he was, that he would serve under Vader/Skywalker but I was watching ROTS and I remembered that he had some legit sense in the dark side and I figured he would make a genuinely excellent Inquisitor.

The reasoning behind doing this is that Ahsoka is getting too old and will be unable to finish The Child's training and so would offload him to N'Kata Del Gormo in an era where there are many generations of jedi.

Disney plus has released a new LEGO Star Wars Christmas movie, and as a fan of both LEGO and Star Wars, I decided to watch it.

The movie is about Rey who went to a temple to learn how she could properly train Finn. At the temple she finds a mysterious artifact that opens portals to anywhere. She uses it to watch masters, and their apprentices. During this sequence she fights darth Vader, and goes through many different portals.

One of the portals they went through landed at, you guessed it!

With some basic inferencing we can tell that the child is the apprentice, and the mandalorian is the master.

This raises the question- ""Could this be Obi-Wan and Satine's son?"" If so, my theory is that this would be Rey's father, meaning that Obi-Wan Kenobi is her grandfather.

805,1605660278.0,StarWarsTheories,"Din Djarin Kenobi? It sounds nuts, but hear me out. It is a fun rabbit hole at least. - Welcome to the rabbit hole I've been going down the past couple of hours, most of which could be disproved by the end of season 2, or even just Friday's episode.

I think Din Djarin is a Kenobi. I know, I'm nuts. But hear me out, at the least it should be a fun read. The idea works well with common story archtypes and poetic tropes, and I hope you will at least consider me less crazy by the end of this. Feel free to pick me apart if i have something wrong.

------

Here's what we know of Din:
He was raised on some backwater planet, and like many star wars protagonists, was orphaned.
He claims he is not truly a Mandalorian. His parents are only seen as blurs.
Amidst all the chaos on his planet during the fall of the New Republic, he is sought out and saved by members of the death watch.

He lives a relatively mundane life of a bounty hunter, until he meets Baby Yoda. He know little of the time in-between. But he knows Tatooine well, and can speak Sand People.
He breaks protocol and saves Baby Yoda, bringing the wrath of the Empire forces down upon him.
He should by all means be dead. Instead, something unexpected happens.
The underground secretive sect of The Watch, which has been hiding for years on this planet, break all cover and sacrifice themselves to save Din. We see a big pile of empty helmets. This is the way.

-------
The Darksaber:
Wielded by the first (only?) Mandalorian Jedi. It is a symbol of the right to rule Mandalore. Prior to the fall of Mandalore, Duchess Satine Kryze was in charge of Mandalore, but did not possess the weapon.
It is now held by Moff Gideon, the current big bad of the Mandalorian show.
I suspect Din will confront Gideon and reclaim the Mandalorian Dark Saber. But who is he to rule? He might think to return it to Bo-Katan Kryze, as Sabine did, but Bo-Katan has already shown that she might not be the best custodian for the weapon.

-------
The Force Awakens?:
I suspect that like many of the star wars orphans, he may not have been raised by his biological parents. Enter the whole Satine+Kenobi conspiracy.
One though floating around the internet in the early days of The Force Awakens was that Rey could be a Kenobi, perhaps a descendant of a secret lovechild, forbidden by the Jedi order. A child who perhaps was hidden away from Mandalore, adopted.
Maybe that was almost right. Maybe there was a secret child, hidden away on a distant world. A world where the child could be protected by The Watch.
Why did the Watch save the young Din? Why did the watch blow its cover completely to save him? Why did most of the watch see him as the odd-man-out?
The watch was tasked with raising and protecting him after the planet fell, by some oath or code, whether they liked it or not. This is the way.

--------
Obi Wan:
Now, you might say, this is crazy. There's no way they could establish that. Do you know what it would take to explain Obi Wan having a secret love child? That would take an entire series...they would have to make... an Obi Wan... series?
Wait, what's the plot of the Obi Wan series going to be? I mean, he's stuck on Tatooine right, guarding Luke from threats like Maul? He can't go anywhere. The most he could do it reminisce about the good old days and have strange encounters on Tatooine right?
Wait. Didn't Din say he had been to Tatooine 'many times' before and had never heard of Mos Pelgo? Who taught Din how to communicate with Sand People? You would have to be some crazy hermit to try learn how to communicate with sand people...

-----
Jedi:
Din Djarin is very very silver and covered in Beskar these days. But look back to the start of his adventure. Ask yourself, if you were to create a Mandalorian Jedi, how would you design him? Would he wear some take on the brown and tan robes of the Jedi order? Now look at that design.
Master Yoda trained Obi Wan and Anakin. Anakin and Obi Wan Trained Asoka. Asoka gets to train Din(Kenobi) and Yoda. It’s poetic in a way.

----------------------------------------------------------
And now its time to Pick apart my crazy conspiracy with questions:

Q: But the Death Watch was evil right?

A: In the Clone Wars series, sure. But in the Star Wars Legends, parts of which Filoni has slowly brought back to canon, they pre-existed Pre Vizla, who just managed to gather splintered members of the group.
Also note, Bo-Katan referred to them as ""The Watch"" not ""The Death Watch,"" meaning they may not be one in the same. Their version of ""The Way"" seems to run different from the Death Watch's.

----------

Q: If your zany conspiracy idea is right (and there's no way it is, you're a crazy man) Din Djarin, the son of Obi Wan, would be trained by Ahsoka Tano, the student of Kenobi's student? And then what, would he claim the heirloom lightsaber of The Mandalore gaining the full respect and backing of the fractured Watch Mandalorians?
And then what, find out his true heritage from the forge master and get recognized by the New Mandalorians as the heir of Sabine's legacy?
That's crazy, wouldn't that make him the perfect figurehead for reuniting Mandalore?

A: This is the way."

This may be an unpopular take as the connection between Din Djarin and The Child is so strong. But I think that the best outcome is that the Mandalorian become an independent series outside of most force related activities. 

Once The Mandalorian finds Ahsoka I theorize that Ahsoka will still be with Sabine Wren. They are possibly still on the search for Ezra Bridger as they were left off at the end of Rebels. The Mandalorian will have completed his creed task of returning the child to his kind. Thus freeing him to return to his life, yet now that he has come in contact with Bo-Katan and possibly Sabine Wren he is well aware of how the empire has decimated his home world of Mandalore and scattered his people across the galaxy. 

The core of this theory is that Ahsoka and The Child will stay together possibly progressing The Child’s story in the rumored Ahsoka series that may come to Disney+. They will work on learning the force and possibly finding Ezra in the proses. While that is happening Din Djarin, Bo-Katan and Sabine Wren will go on the offensive to find the dark saber (like Bo was talking about in S2E3) and re-unite Mandalore. 

I believe this gives Disney a lot more options on how to approach The Mandalorian series and the Rumored Ahsoka series. The Mandalorian going forward without The Child will be able to explore more Outer Rim themes and Crime Syndicates. While the Ahsoka series now having The Child as a character can be a rebuilding of the Jedi order (especially if the sequel movies do get moved out of Cannon) while possibly trying to find Ezra and other Jedi. 

The big question of this is how does the cameo of Boba at the end of S2E1 fit in? Well it could go 2 ways. Temuera Morrison the actor that played Jango in the Prequels was shown at the end of the episode. But his character could either be Boba or Captain Rex because genetically they are the same physical person. So the tease at the end of S2E1 could either be Boba looking for his armor or Captain Rex possibly looking for Din Djarin as Ahsoka may have sent him looking for The Child that she may have sensed through the force. 

If you actually read all of this thank you and I would love to hear your opinions on this theory."
809,1605538935.0,StarWarsTheories,"Theory I came up with involving Starkiller from the Force Unleashed and Rey - This is more or less my idea for how he could be adapted into the new canon and it involves a lot of retcons but I do like the idea I came up with. Here's my theory Starkiller and Juno Eclipse are the parents of Rey and the events of the Force Unleashed were a subtle and elaborate plot Palpatine to create a worthy heir.

Here is my thinking Juno Eclipse was the daughter of Palpatine but was cast aside due to not being a force sensitive and she lived a relatively normal life in complete ignorance. At the same time Darth Vader finds a young Starkiller and seeing his power takes him on as a secret apprentice. Sidious however knew of Vader's deception and allowed it (I would not be shocked if this happened he's pulled off some elaborate shit in the past) because he saw the boy as a means of achieving his goals.

I think this is what really happened behind the scenes Sidious played match maker with his daughter and Starkiller neither knew and Palpatine's hopes for a relationship blossoming came to pass. This was done to create a truly powerful force sensitive and it worked. At some point Juno died and her father's identity was revealed to them to protect Rey Starkiller abandoned her or left her with those that did.

I also think it'd possible Starkiller played a role in the founding of the Knights of Ren (I thought about his helmet in the bad ending and I it resembles those worn by the knights of Ren) this is a major retcon but I think it could work. I think after losing Juno and Rey, Starkiller formed the knights using the remaining Inquisitors, and Shadow Guard but ultimately a member split and formed his own rogue faction which would go on to recruit Ben Solo. I like this idea as it really would flesh out the Shadow Guard, Inquisitors and more importantly the Knights of Ren as not only fully canonized elements but credible threats.

I can see the Knights becoming a new threat after the fall of the First Order and for things to not improve for the good guys. What I'm thinking is a new form of government rises that leans more towards the Empire but has more freedoms and for this to cause drama with the heroes causing them to split and fight with each other. Essentially the Knights resurface but unlike before they all have red light sabers and are structured like the old Jedi Order with shadow guards protecting the temple, and inquisitors enforcing their version of law and order.

I really like this idea because I like the idea of an enemy that is morally grey and leaves the heroes questioning if they are on the right side and I think a revamped Knights of Ren could be that. This also adds to Rey using the Skywalker name as I can see Starkiller being considered like the adopted son of Darth Vader or something."

811,1605466248.0,StarWarsTheories,"Thinkings,questions, and possible theories regarding Mando, Rebels, and the Han Solo movie. Criticize my ignorance, you may. - Despite feeling that some of these episodes are rushed and “medium-effort” I love the plot and the direction it is going. When I start seeing old characters make appearances my mind instantly goes into detective mode because I am anxious and cannot wait a few weeks to probably have these questions answered (maybe not). 
-First things first, I think Boba Fett, Cobb Vanth, and the old Lady that babysits the Child are all working with a crime syndicate as spies in the aftermath of the empire, and NOT involved with Moff Gideon whatsoever. 
- After being saved by Dengar from the Sarlac pit (I think that is all that is mentioned in the one EU book) Boba Fett leaves the planet and begins involving himself with the Crimson Dawn (?) (also I would love to see Han Solo’s girlfriend make an appearance) and taking up contracts again. 
 -He still has his armor at this point and its a little rusty but he can wear it and it functions like normal. For 5 years he begins to reestablish his repetoire among the bounty hunters of the syndicate and eventually they get word of the child’s whereabouts (given the description he knows the child to be of Master Yodas race, and we know how much Boba likes Jedi. 
-Cobb Vanth, Boba, and presumably others make the trip to Tatooine with Mos Pelgros coordinated sent by the lady (sorry I forget her name). They kill a few raiders, Boba dons the Tusken apparel while Cobb Vanth wears the notorious armor. Just think about. **Why are they in the same location and why would Boba just ditch his armor?** I am a little confident with this one so please call me out.

Separate discussion... So Bo Katan is back and gave Mando the coordinates to planet Corvus (from onscreen subtitles) but from what know there is no planet Corvus. There is a ship, The Corvus, not a forest planet, which is a possibility and would be great to see an ode to a Star Wars game. And there is a planet called Corvis Minor from an older novel. 
1. New planet entirely
2. Imperial Cruiser Corvus
3. Corvis Minor
All I can say is its one of three, probably:)))
Aside from this, whenever and wherever Mando and the Child meet Ahsoka, who will be with her and what will have happened to her in the 5 years since she and Sabine set off to search for Ezra? Will they have found Ezra or did they give up the search? 

This next episode I am really hoping Bo Katan gave Mando coordinates to the Imperial Ship Corvus from the Battlefront campaign mode. The ship has holding cells and could potentially be holding Ahsoka in a cell, as a farce or actual imprisonment. Bo Katan seemed to want to test Mando and the next episode is due to be filler anyway, in the end maybe we will get the first scene of Ahsoka. 

Sorry for the long post and please help me try and decipher what will happen going forward. Thanks!"

813,1605462703.0,StarWarsTheories,"Disney will make George Lucas's trilogy happen - So this is a odd theory I've formed and it's more wishful thinking but I do have some ideas as to how this theory will come to pass I've seen the recent buzz about George's trilogy involving Darth Maul and Talon and it's gotten a few fans excited. I think it could still happen and these are a few of my ideas.

1. The Darth Maul that died in Rebels wasn't the true Darth Maul. After cloning has been introduced I wouldn't be shocked if this was used as a scapegoat and I'm perfectly fine with that. I can absolutely see the Maul that appeared in Solo being the true Darth Maul and for it to come out he sent a clone to die so he could thrive in the shadows.
2. The Mandalorian will change destiny and if Luke appears he'll have a force vision that will allow him to prevent the events of the Sequels. I like this idea because I can see something like this being the set up for a Maul movie as well (honestly both these things happening would be epic) where before his death he has a vision of Sidious surviving and is presented with the option of no longer pursuing Obiwan and instead after a long wait he finds and finishes off a dying Sidious and destroys everything that led to Snoke even going as far as to kill off Palpatine's bloodline including a young Rey.

My basis for this is simply the fact that Disney likes making money and with fans taking an interest in Georges's original plans I can see them going ""Okay let's bring back Maul with some low effort story telling and retcons oh hell let's toss out the sequels while we're at it."" Really though life has just taught me to never underestimate how far companies will go to make a buck and that's why I think they'll do something like this."
814,1605376400.0,StarWarsTheories,"Order 66 Obi-wan and the 501st legion and the 212th attack battalion. - I rewatched the Revenge of the sith last night because my dad suggested watching a Star Wars movie because we both like it and I chose it because I wanted to see it again. 
   While watching it I noticed that after Commander Cody got the order for order 66 and had the other clones to shoot the cannon at Obi-wan he didn’t kill any of them that we see. I think that he didn’t want to take the risk of any on the clones to report that he was still alive before he could finish them off. Maybe also because he couldn’t bring himself to do it. 
   Now for the 501st legion. When Obi-wan and Yoda are going to the Jedi temple we see Obi-wan killing the 501st without hesitation. I think this is because his own troops tried to kill him and he knows that it’s the same with the other Jedi. He probably doesn’t hesitate to kill any of the 501st because they were lead by Anakin and he probably thinks that he was killed and is mad at the 501st for killing Anakin because he doesn’t know that he’s not at the Jedi temple or on corasaunt."

A character that started out in an animated show made its live action debut! Now, this is a first in Star wars (other than Saw Gerrera but honestly they just slapped that name on top of the character that they written for Rogue one cause it fit) .

Bo-Katan just works, they nailed the character, she had a very distinctive silhouette and way of moving in TCW, in mando she is EXACTLY the same!

Moving on though, onto my theory: Is it just me or are Children of the Watch likely Maul's initiative? It just seems like the kind of thing that ex-sith taught by Palps would do. Very reminiscent of the First Order's stormtrooper program.

(WARNING, SPOILERS FOR SEASON 2)

Here are some examples:

S01E01 - Mando is cold blooded at the beginning, working together with sort of bounty hunter we are familiar with (IG-11 instead of IG-88), big reveal at the end: An infant of Yoda species - The Child (aka Baby Yoda)  
S02E01 - Mando is cold blooded at the beginning, working together with sort of ""bounty hunter"" we are familiar with (Cobb Vanth in Fett's armor instead of Boba Fett himself), big reveal at the end: Real Boba Fett and he's alive

S01E02 - We learn more about The Child (Force sensitive, savior), Razor Crest is damaged by Jawas and then repaired, encounter with Mudhorn  
S02E02 - We learn more about The Child (trouble maker, is saved by Frog Lady), Razor Crest is damaged by crash and then repaired, encounter with Krykna

And today, it kind of confirmed my theory for me. I was hoping to see Bo Katan saving Mando in this chapter, because it would be a perfect opportunity, and it happened!:

823,1605163005.0,StarWarsTheories,"Baby Yoda ""age jump"" theory (spoilers) - I have a theory about Mandalorian that I'm not sure anyone has discussed. As we are aware, ""Baby Yoda"" will be (presumably) just beginning to enter an adult age when The Mandalorian (the character...not the show) is nearing the end of his life. Some have speculated that Mando will be his guardian as a baby, and we may never see his adult form due to the differential in their age/species.

However, I believe that at some point, possibly at the end of this season (although that may be too early) the Mandalorian will be captured and frozen in Carbonite for several decades, allowing Baby Yoda's aging to catch up to his a bit, at least to the point that he may become ""Young Teenage Yoda"". At that point, he would have been trained by...Asoka (before she died, whenever that is) as well as any other force user they deem worthy.

Although I don't agree with what I'm about to write (gulp), they could even incorporate Sequel Trilogy characters from that point forward (I hope I'm wrong there).

Think about it from 2 perspectives....Firstly, the Showrunners: creators want a character to have a natural ""arc"" throughout their series. Unfortunately, if he remained as a non-communicative infant, Baby Yoda's character arc would be practically nonexistent.

Now, from a merchandising standpoint (Disney): you can only milk the ""Baby Yoda"" character so much before it becomes oversaturated. We're seeing this currently, as merchandise is crowding store shelves everywhere. Toy Stores. Department stores. Neighborhood pharmacies (cvs/walgreens/etc). I even saw a whole shelf of Baby Yoda toys at the gas station I stop at on my way home from work (and it's a small privately owned business). When the market dries up, something will have to change. So...imagine if Baby Yoda is a bit older, and brandishing a lightsaber. We saw the evidence that they may go that route (in Season 2 episode 1) as they were hacking apart the Krayt Dragon, showing us the ""pearl"".

So, how do we fast forward his age while keeping the Mandalorian's age the same? Stick the Mando in the ol' Carbonite freezer!! He's already a wanted man....Boba Fett loves him some Carbonite captives, too. Plus, Mando has a Carbonite machine equipped on his ship.

Obviously, none of this is certain. We don't even know if he will ever age in the show, instead electing to stay as the mischievous, overarching McGuffin of the serialized plot. But...it would be bad ass to see the Mandalorian being frozen in a season finale, only to have a Jabba-palace style jailbreak open up the following season premiere, with ""not-baby-anymore"" Yoda brandishing a lightsaber!!"

825,1605063808.0,StarWarsTheories,"Anakin is NOT the chosen one - So, The Rise of Skywalker is.. bad. Oh, it is so so so bad. One complaint I've been hearing which I agreed with at first was that Palpatine being brought back to life completely ruins the chosen one prophecy presented in the Prequel Trilogy that was given to Anakin, which he later fulfills in Return of the Jedi when he killed Palpatine, thereby bringing balance to the Force as the prophecy suggested. Like I said, at first, I agreed with this, but after some more examination, I am under the belief that Anakin is not the chosen one in the first place. Neither is Rey, Luke, Leia, Kylo, Chewbacca, Wee-teef Cyubee- nobody is the chosen one. Let me explain:

There is plenty of evidence and it is pretty much confirmed in a Darth Vader comic (though I'm pretty sure the author said something like ""Well, the Dark Side is not a reliable source of facts"" or something like that, but all the evidence just points to it) that Palpatine is the creator of Anakin. First off, in The Phantom Menace Anakin's mother said that there was no father, and she was just pregnant out of nowhere, which lead the Jedi to believe that Anakin is the chosen one, said to bring balance to the Force. 

Also, in Revenge of the Sith, Palpatine tells Anakin the story of Darth Plaguis the Wise, a very obvious former master of Palpatine that new how to manipulate the Midichlorians to create life.  So, with Palpatine being the former apprentice of Plaguis, he would definitely have learned all of Plaguis' abilities, so it's very likely that Palpatine manipulated the Midichlorians to create Anakin. 

But, if that *is* the case, and Palpatine did make Anakin, then why would Anakin bring balance to the Force? He was created by the Dark Side, by Palpatine himself to most likely be the perfect Dark Side warrior. So, why would Anakin be destined to destroy the Dark Side, if he was made by the Dark Side? Well, my theory is that he wasn't. He wasn't the chosen one at all, and he was just a guy.

But, why did Anakin have such a high Midichlorian count? Well, it's the same reason Rey had such a high Midichlorian count. He was basically the son of Palpatine, so he got the extreme Force power Palpatine had.

Why did he kill Palpatine? Why do you think? His son was going to die! That wasn't him bringing balance to the Force, that was him saving his child!

Basically, this makes sure that Palpatine's return, while still having no evidence towards it, doesn't laugh in the face of the prophecy established in both Star Wars trilogies before it. But, it also makes Rey and Kylo kissing having them commit incest, and... yeah, I got nothing for that. Those two are just weird."
826,1605056646.0,StarWarsTheories,"Ahsoka will die by the Mandalorian's hand. - 1. Ahsoka is one of the Jedi\* that speak to Rey in RoS, all other Jedi in that scene were dead, and most, if not all, were powerful enough to become force ghosts. This points strongly to the fact that Ahsoka is dead.
2. Ahsoka has been cast for the Mandalorian. No other appearances are planned.
3. Mando is an exceptionally skilled Mandalorian with thick, heavy, pure Baskar steel. The show reverences the ""old ways"" of armor making, hinting to the fact that his armor was forged for the express use of Jedi killing. The most notable weapon in this arsenals' are the whistling birds, dozens of micro missiles that spread out , only to hit a target simultaneously from all angles.

I believe that there is a strong possibility that IF Mando meets Ahsoka, and IF they have a strong enough conflict of interest to fight, than Mando is the only one walking away from that fight. This is not very well supported by cannon though, as Ahsoka would probably rather help Mando than fight him.

829,1604856869.0,StarWarsTheories,"My own theory on how Boba escaped the Sarlaac. - I think the Sarlaac was killed, and not by a Krayt dragon. It was either killed by the explosion of Jabbas Sail Barge sending thousands of metal shards into it, by Boba and his arsenal of weapons, or both. 

Boba killing the Sarlaac with or without the help of the explosion would make most sense to me. In Cobb Vanth’s flashback, he sees Boba’s armor including the jetpack, which does not have the original long range missile that was on the pack in Return of the Jedi. So I think Boba shot the rocket and whatever else he had that still worked into the Sarlaac. Maybe a weak point or something. The smaller missile Vanth had on the pack seemed to make the Krayt dragon pretty angry, so I have no doubt that the bigger one could kill such a small Sarlaac.

Why would Boba kill the Sarlaac instead of just flying out? Boba has to make sure he can fly out without being pulled back down by one of the tentacles. Boba also probably shed his armor and helmet before leaving and only took the jetpack. This would explain why the Jawas found the armor inside of the Sarlaac and why Boba has acid scars on his face despite wearing his helmet when falling in. If Boba got grabbed by the Sarlaac while flying out without his armor, the Sarlaac would probably kill him.

-Slight spoilers for Mandalorian Season 2 Episode 2-
Also, we see that the jetpack could easily work and fly without being attached to anyone, so it’s very possible  Boba activated the jet pack with the wrist gauntlet and flew out, maybe even clearing a path with the flamethrower.

So in this situation, Boba is gone from the Sarlaac by the time the Jawas get there, which explains why Boba didn’t just kill the Jawas or take his armor back after they found him."

It goes on about the business of digesting.

 Suddenly, the sand begins to vibrate, barely perceptible at first, but the vibration increases...soon it's a violent tremor...and then a burst of sand and screaming krayt dragon roar. The explosion of the sail barge attracted a dragon to the pit, and he's hungry. 

The dragon bursts out of the Tattoine desert, pulling the sarlaac out of its sandy respite, ripping it to shreds, and throwing bodies and skeletal remains across the desert plain, also tossing the burning sail barge end over end until it lands in a smoking heap, and there, just in view of the camera as the dragon recedes back underground, lies the unconscious body of the still living yet badly injured Fett. 

As night falls, and Fett still lies motionless, we see a sandcrawler coming into view as the camera fades to black...

Jango Fett might have been a common bounty hunter who acquired Mandalorian armor, according to Almec. However, that does not mean that Boba didn’t turn to the Mandalorians after the death of his father. This could have possibly happened between when we see him in The Clone Wars (TV series) and his appearance in the original trilogy. Boba possibly made armor modeled after his father’s armor, this time with Beskar (instead of durasteel) and his own flare (color, logos, etc.) This may explain Boba’s Mythosaur Skull on his shoulder plate, something not present on his father’s armor, and the other slight deviations. This may also explain why “Cobb Vanth’s” armor is able to deflect the blaster shot in the cantina."

It’s also an intriguing option of how Vanth comes into possession of the armor. Could his explanation of becoming the Marshall be Boba’s story reiterated by an imposter?? Thinking Boba not to take his bucket off, Vanth comes across the same armor used when he was able to escape with ice cream box of silicax crystals. 
He says he knows where the Krayt dragon lives. He’s very apprehensive about the Tuskan Raiders, as they have been attacking his settlement. Could they have been given a bounty to get that armor back?? Boba appears to have the two weapons(toothbrush) that the sand people travel with.

My theory is that either this character is either Boba Fett, looking to take back his armor from Mando (because as we can obviously see the armor wore by Cobb Vanth is Boba's) or it's Captain Rex looking for Mando so he can help Mando get to Ashoka. I feel like they both are likely because of that armor that Mando takes from Cobb and because Ashoka is already confirmed to be in Mandalorian and that would be a great story arc with Rex and Mando traveling the galaxy in search of Ashoka while being chased by Moff Gideon. Also, Rex has been rumored to appear in the show. Maybe they both will appear."

The only thing that kept Maul alive on Lotho Minor was his yearning for revenge. After the night mother revives Maul on Dathomir that same yearning is his motivation for almost anything he does.

We see time and time again through The Clone Wars and even in Rebels their connection, for example when Obi Wan realizes Maul is alive, as well as when Maul finally finds him on tattooine. 

The rules of the dyad are pretty vaguely set out in The Last Skywalker, and I figured since the newest trilogy did a lot of things wrong, what if they explained what a dyad is wrong. I feel like Maul and Obi Wan’s connection through the force is a lot more feasible than what Rey and Kylo had. If this theory is true then I feel like this is what a dyad should be. Rather than space time buddies cause Snoke was a big fan of the Reylo ship. If Snoke is what nudged their dyad to be stronger, is that what the Night Mother did for Obi Wan and Maul?

The noticeable difference is that this one does not have glasses or as deep of eye sockets, but this movie does take place 30 years before the events in The Force Awakens. Maybe her eyesight declined in those years and her sockets being so noticeable is due to the strange glasses.

Anakin would force push Obi Wan back and jump, while Obi Wan is dazed on the ground Anakin will strike the final blow, decapitating Obi Wan, Anakin then throws his body into the lava river as we see tears running down his face. Anakin would then run back to Padme checking her vitals and taking her to the same medical center as we see in ROTS, with Anakin there she has a successful delivery and does not die. As she is sleeping in the room, he will check the twins midichlorian count, Anakin would be shocked to see that the twins midichlorian counts would level out at 15,000. Anakin would then take Padme home to Naboo where she would raise the children. Padme would believe that Anakin had turned back to the light side at the sight of her children, so all of his trips to Coruscant were to attempt to rebuild the order in secret, when really he was learning from Palpatine. 6 years later Anakin would take the children to Coruscant, telling Padme that the time had come for them to become younglings. He would begin secretly training them in the dark and light side of the force. Telling them that one day they will rule the galaxy. After the Imperial Senate is dissolved by Palpatine in 0BBY, Padme would join the Rebellion, acting as a secret supplier of ships and weaponry, much like what Bail Organa was doing prior to his death. (Anakin would not know she was with the rebellion because he would be training the now 19 year old Luke and Leia, who became known as Darths) Then when the rebellion caught word of the destruction of Alderaan (Alderran would still be destroyed because of Bail Organa) they were worried they might destroy Naboo as well. The Rebellion sent multiple ships to help escort Padme or ""Baze"" out of Naboo's planetary blockade, as per Anakin's orders to keep Padme safe. However, on the way out of the system their ship would be destroyed by a squad of TIE fighters led by Sio Bibble (Governor of Naboo). Padme was dead. Anakin would be in the middle of training Luke and Leia when Sio Bibble appeared on Anakin's holocom with sweat dripping down his face, he would say ""My lord, I regret to inform you that your wife, Padme, was killed by a squad of TIE fighters attacking a..."" He could not finish because Anakin would reach across with the force and start choking Bibble, Anakin then says ""I do not want to hear your excuses for the death of Padme."" Bibble's body shakes violently as his head gets ripped to a 90 degree angle, snapping his neck. We go to Dagobah as Yoda is cooking a stew of some kind when all of the sudden he drops the pot holding it, Obi Wan's force ghost senses it to, he appears in front of Yoda, ""something is wrong I can feel it."" ""much hatred and loss I can sense from young Skywalker."" Yoda would say. ""Obi Wan go you must, attempt to bring him back to the light, before to late it is."" Anakin would be sitting on his bed in his sleeping quarters when, Obi Wan appears in front of him, Before he can say a word Anakin pulls his lightsaber towards him, activating it, the glowing crimson blade contrasts with the pale blue of Obi Wan's force ghost,""Anakin,"" pleads Obi Wan ""All of this could have been avoided if you did not embrace the dark and join Palpatine,"" ""Your right, It could have,"" Obi Wan starts to have a glimmer of hope, as Anakin turns off the lightsaber, ""If I didn't join Palpatine, This would never had happened."" Anakin starts getting his robes on, ""What are you doing?"" Asks Obi Wan. ""I am going to kill the Emperor, I am going to end this once and for all."" Anakin states blatantly. ""And how, exactly do you plan to do that?"" Obi Wan asks suspiciously, ""What is killing the Emperor going to do?"" Anakin then as if annoyed says, ""It will end his rule, He has controlled me to long, I am going to become the new emperor."" Then Obi Wan can no longer talk to Anakin, He had shut him out, Anakin walks down the hall of the Imperial Palace, Flanked by his Apprentices, Luke and Leia. As the door opens the 2 royal guards get thrown out the window by the enraged Anakin, the lights begin to flicker then go out. 4 red lightsaber blades cut through the darkness, Anakin and Leia with their single bladed lightsabers ignited, and Luke with his double blade. Palpatine's cackling can be heard over the distinct hum of the lightsabers, ""As I did mine, you attempt to take my position as master, I cannot be defeated only delayed."" ""I am here to finish your reign, I will take my place as Emperor!"" Anakin yells. Palpatine stands and ignites his lightsaber. Palpatine is strong, the battle is raging, red clashing with red as flashes of blue pulse from volleys of force lighting get thrown at the master and his apprentices. ""You dare betray me! Leia locks blades with Palpatine and he uses this to his advantage, Leia jolts as her body is hit by force lightning. This enrages Anakin, while Palpatine is focusing all of his hate onto Leia, we see a red blade pierce his chest. The lightning stops, and Palpatine slides to the floor. Anakin declares himself Emperor. ""I want you to take Vader's Fist and go destroy anyone loyal to the Emperor. I will call a meeting of the officers and you can pick them off. I will kill the Emperor's advisors."" Anakin orders the twins. Anakin immediately visits the Death Star. He orders a full evacuation of the Death Star except for essential personnel. Anakin plans to destroy Tatooine, if he was still under control of Palpatine, he would have never been able to do this, destroy Tatooine, wipe out the place that gave him such sorrow and despair. He stood on the view port of the Death Star, Flanked by the Executor. The super laser powered up and, ""Boom!"" the planet was reduced to a cloud of dust and debris. Anakin can feel a weight being lifted off his chest. As Anakin returns to Coruscant he gives an executive order to all Imperial units, any Rebel sympathizers are to be killed and shot on sight, no prisoners. The Death Star would get destroyed while Anakin was on Coruscant, Anakin would not build a second Death Star, The Imperial Fleet would be sent to Hoth to bombard the planet, effectively destroying the Rebel cell there. Anakin would then go and fight Luke and Leia, who wanted to kill him and become the emperor and empress. Anakin would lose the the 2 and be killed. Han Solo and Leia would never have had Ben, Luke would never start the Jedi temple, and Rey would never had been born. (It is because her father was a clone of Palpatine, however he spent years after the battle of Yavin attempting to get the first one right, so he would have died and stayed dead.)

846,1603683822.0,StarWarsTheories,"Knights of Ren connected to Mandalorians. - I just want to preface this because I keep causing miscommunication. I am fully aware of the Rise of Kylo Ren comic, I've read each issue. We learn very little about the Knights of Ren, other than that they worship the Darkside as ""The Shadow"" and call lightsabers ""Ren"".   


I think it's possible the Knights were originally formed by worshippers of former Mandolores with Force-Sensitivity. Specifically Tarre Vizla, Darth Revan (stretching a little bit by making him a Mandolore) and Darth Maul. 

  
My evidence:  


* The Knights hold masks in high regard, even Kylo, which is similar to how Mandos hold their helmets sacred.
* They call the Darkside ""The Shadow"", which is a name Maul went by.
* In Legends the Mandalore that Revan defeats was also called ""The Great Shadow"", and while I'm here Revan defeating him makes him an unofficial Mandalore.
* It'd be pretty cool."
847,1603677978.0,StarWarsTheories,"[Star Wars Theory] Why Yoda seemed so different in The Last Jedi - Have you ever noticed how ghost-Yoda seemed different in The Last Jedi?

At first I thought it was odd, almost too goofy, but after some digging I think I know why he was portrayed this way. In the Prequels and Original trilogy Yoda is either concerned about the looming threat of the Sith or exiled in shame of his failure. The poor guy has had an unbearable weight on his shoulders for decades.

When he transitions into the lifestream of the force he’s finally released from his worries. He’s done all he can and he can finally rest and reflect on his life.

In the Last Jedi we’re introduced to this unburdened Yoda. He’s jovial, relaxed and confident. Instead of worrying, he’s embraced the unknown. with confidence he gives a final lecture to Luke; “we are what they grow beyond”, trusting that he’ll do the right thing.

849,1603472175.0,StarWarsTheories,"High Republic Story Line - The new series coming out about the High Republic had me concerned for a while.  I mean, how much conflict could we really deal with? 1000 years of peace, o goodie, should be a good watch. But after thinking about it, I really hope they use the Sith effectively.

So a few rules to follow.
1. No one is stronger than Palpatine.
2. Must fear being caught above all else.  
3. Working to corrupt/diminish Jedi connection to light. 
4. The Jedi can't find bodies with lightsaber damage. 
5. Have to begin working through politicians. 

 The lineage from Bane to Sidious is so long, and we know so little of it.  I really hope they give us somel Sith Lords struggling to deal with their own Power Level vs. The Entire Jedi Order. They could connect this back to the shows and movies with philosophies that would corrupt the Order and make it possible for the Government to be infected. 

Sith control over: Trade Fed, Banking Clan, Robotics Union, the Criminal Underground, finally corrupting Senators.  Creating free standing armies Seperate of the Republic, like the Geonocians and many other Seperatist worlds. Finally, instilling slavery in outer rim worlds and with the Criminal Underground, this will create the most fear around the galaxy(people/children disappearing in the night. 

Good fights are necessary for the SWU, but the Sith were extinct for 1000 years. A gleaming red blade is kind of a clear give away, so I think it would be very cool to have a battle trained sith vs. two arrogant Jedi. The Sith would bob and weave with some vibro blades, through their uncoordinated sloppy attacks.  Eliminating both with clean cuts, and leaving the remnants of the battle.  

There are plenty of stories about the Jedi and we need more Sith. Powerful, conflicted characters who see the Jedi and Republic as the cause of their suffering."

What are your thoughts? Plausible or nah?
853,1603198775.0,StarWarsTheories,"""Baby Yoda"" is actually Baby Yoda - Title.

Fight me.

No but actually I think it would be wild if somehow this force sensitive infant \[Yoda species\] is the being who will grow up to be Master Yoda.

The Empire/Palpatine has identified him, which is why they want him so bad. Why ""he means more to me than you will ever know."" That's a deep line. That suggests more than Gideon simply wanting a pet force-using baby.

Now, time travel exists in Star Wars whether we like it or not. Ezra Bridger literally blinks Ahsoka in and out of time to save her from Vader. While we don't see it, it is theoretically possible that if you can get into the World and reach into another time and pull someone out and put them back in, you could certainly pull them out and put them back in another time. 

In this series of events, we see that Palpatine knows about the World Between, and is even capable of accessing it (although he does seem to have some trouble with it). 

Because of this, the idea that Yoda is somehow in a different time period than he should be wouldn't be foreign to Palpatine. Now, Palpatine doesn't have to have communicated all this to Gideon or any of the rest of his minions, but he certainly could have communicated that acquiring the baby is of the utmost importance.

Why does Palpatine want him? To kill him? To corrupt him? To actually send him back to make sure the plan happens the exact same way? Who knows, but inarguably, having access to an infant Yoda would be highly desirable to Palpatine.

This business of ""returning the baby to his people,"" who Din Djarin calls ""enemy sorcerers,"" won't be about getting lil Yoda to his actual home planet. It will be about getting him to the past, because to the Mandalorians, your people are your tribe, not your species. And the only tribe of Jedi exists in the past (Luke's new temple has not started at this point, far as I know).

Before you all start completely trashing me, let me make one thing clear. I don't actually think this is what will happen in the Mandalorian. I expect it to all be much more down to ~~Earth~~ Endor than that.

In the process I've realized something that I repressed for a long, long time: I am not really a fan of TLJ and TROS. Both movies had their moments and are not bad movies per se but as a Star Wars fan I full-heartedly hate some of the creative decisions that were made with these movies, not just because I wanted to see the narrative play out in a specific way - it is much more than that.

It all begins with the end of Star Wars Rebels: Ahsoka the White and Sabine Wren go in search of Ezra (who would later be with Thrawn). The couple is accompanied by Captain Rex and together they travel the galaxy to find their lost friend (this journey would be told by Filoni in the first season of the Rebels sequel). At some point in this series Ahsoka would be meditating alone in her room when she suddenly feels a presence that she has not felt in a long time, opens her eyes and sees Anakin's ghost (this would happen a few moments after he appeared before Luke together with Ben and Yoda in Endor). Ahoka gets sooo emotional and they talk. In addition to Ani, Yoda appears, and explains her ""that there is another"" like him who is in danger. Now that he wasn't there to protect him, she had to find someone who could. After saying goodbye to the two Jedi Rex appears and enters the room. he sees Ahsoka crying and asks her what's wrong. she tells him she just saw Anakin and then  they share a  looong hug. After this Ahsoka informs Sabine that they must deviate from their course because Someone had entrusted her with a more important mission.

once the Jedi were gone (or so they thought) only the sith were left to deal with. they managed to get their hands on Jedi DNA and were training parts of their army to be force sensitive so they can defeat Vader and Sidious. 

they would openly revolt in 14 bby.  Vader sent the 501st's elite to deal with it.  the hardened war veterans of the 501st would overwhelm the inexperienced Kamino troopers. the force sensitives gave them a tought time but the kamino jedi would tire, slip up and be killed. wanted by the empire, the kamioans reatred to the unknown regions with what was left of their forces.

So in the galaxy there is always good and bad so when Sidious dies in 6 there is only good, but there can’t be only just good there has to be bad and good. And I believe that Luke got so used to there only being good in the galaxy that he couldn’t even sense Sidious surviving across the galaxy that he became force-numb. And so when Ben Solo became evil he snapped and made a rash decision that the luke before sidious “died” wouldn’t have done and so that is why he locked himself away from the galaxy, and became a grumpy old man.

1. So in the galaxy there has always been good and bad even in the golden age of the republic the jedi became blind to the dark side. And when sidious died luke believed that all the darkness in the galaxy had gone. So when he tried to rebuild the Jedi order he became numb to any of the darkness in the galaxy and that is why he tries to kill Ben Solo because he has got use to there only being light and no dark.
2. So he knew he had made a big mistake and so he decided to cut himself from the force and he came. And he came back to being force-numb. When Rey came to ahch-to he still cut himself from the force and only gave in because he could get a second and rectify the mistake he made. So he helps train Rey but at this time he is still force-numb and when he catches Kylo and Rey having a force vision thing then he gets a vision of what happens in the future(and knows about Rey being a palpatine). But it's too late and Rey leaves the island so he decides to rectify his mistake and confront kylo but kylo has become too powerful in the dark side that  luke can only get time for the resistance and not turn kylo back to light."

We see a bird like creature in the sky circling above. 

As we have seen in Rebels, Ahsoka has an affinity with Morai the spirit owl. 

Why was Morai there, to convince Vader, that Ahsoka was dead or to simply watch?

Palpatine: ""And why is that? What could be more important than bringing this war to an end?""

Anakin: ""....... The Council ....... suspects there is a Sith Lord influencing the Senate.""

Palpatine: ""I under the impression that Count Dooku was the Sith Lord.""

Anakin: ""It seems Dooku was the apprentice. If only I hadn't killed him, we could be one step closer to finding the Sith Master.""

Anakin: ""They do seem to be hiding things, about Order and about the Force.""

Anakin: ""How?""

Palaptine: ""Let me help understand the subtleties of the Force. Not just the restrictive view of the Jedi, but the Darker aspects as well.""

866,1602263531.0,StarWarsTheories,"I am currently working on a fan fiction with brand-new characters, but I need to know if this set of text is accurate to SW lore. (NO LEGENDS SOURCES, READ FULL TEXT) - The title says it all. I am planning to make a fan fiction that is as accurate to Star Wars Lore as possible, but in order to ensure that, I need some input on this set of text I made.

I would assume that force-sensitive beings can call upon masters who have become one with the Force. I mean, Obi-Wan and Yoda were able to communicate with Luke themselves in ROTJ, but I'm not completely sure if it can be done the opposite way. Therefore, I need clarification on that too, if possible. But it won't be the only thing I need clarification on.

Oh, and one more thing before we begin: All references to events in the ""Legends"" continuity will be ignored. I am ONLY focusing on the ""Canon"" continuity established by the film saga, the ""Clone Wars"" movie and series, the ""Rebels"" series, The Mandalorian, and other select sources (see [here](https://starwars.fandom.com/wiki/Canon) for more information on Star Wars Canon). I know that people are going to get on me for this, but I am NOT going to tolerate people ignoring the established Canon, or just flat-out refusing to even ACKNOWLEDGE it. Furthermore, I detest it when people decide to pick and choose what events from Star Wars as a whole is Canon (also known as ""cherrypicking""). We can like or dislike those events all we want (LEGO Star Wars events come to mind), but that does NOT change the Canon OR Legends continuity.

In other words: You don't have to LIKE the established Canon, you just have to acknowledge it and accept it.

With that being said, here's the set of text I'm thinking about putting in the FF (I will change it as needed):

\-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

\[Lia Dargona calls upon the Force Spirit of Grand Master Yoda, who had passed several years prior to her training with Luke Skywalker.\]

Dargona: Master Yoda? I know you can hear my voice from beyond. I need to speak with you, if at all possible.

\[Yoda's Force Spirit manifests in front of Dargona, then begins speaking.\]

Yoda: Lia Dargona. A significant amount of power, you have. Abusing it, I trust you are not?

Dargona: No, Master Yoda. I assure you, I have not.

Yoda: Very good. How may I assist you?

Dargona: I have been thinking very hard on this... I know the Jedi's moral code. ""Fear is the start of the path to the Dark Side. Fear leads to anger, anger leads to hate, and hate leads to suffering."" But there are times when the code conflicts with my OWN morals, or even my own missions as a Jedi. To explain further, there are terrorist organizations across the Galaxy whose deeds are so horrid and unforgivable, they make Sith Lords seem more like protectors than oppressors.

Yoda: ...I see. Troubling, this is.

Dargona: Yeah. I've been pushed to my limits both physically AND mentally. I have been debating whether I need to... let some of my emotions loose, if you know what I mean. But I am also concerned that if I do just that, the Dark Side will take over my mind and soul.

Yoda: Hmm... Understand, I do. Indeed, strong, the Dark Side is. Corrupt a Jedi, it can. However, be broken at times, even the Jedi code must.

Dargona: ! ...Really?

Yoda: Yes. These terrorist organizations you speak of... destroyed many civilizations across the Galaxy, they have. One of the many reasons, they are, for creating the Jedi code.

Dargona: Huh... So, does that mean...

Yoda: Let your emotions run too wild, as long as you do not, broken at times, the Jedi code must be.

Dargona: ...Alright. I'll make sure to remember that.

Yoda: Remember also: let these terrorists destroy the Galaxy's way of life, you must not. Destroy them forever, you must.

Dargona: ...I plan on it. Thank you very much for your insight, Master.

Yoda: Very welcome, you are. The Force, may it be with you.

\[Yoda's Force Spirit flies high into the sky and disappears with Dargona looking beyond.\]

Lia Dargona: Farewell... Grand Master of the Force...

Ahsoka would ask Maul who the Sith Lord controlling the Senate is. Maul would say that his master \*is\* the Senate. He would do a big speech and start asking her question like ""Who is the one person that has gained more power over War?"" The one person who was given emergency powers?  The person to stay in office long after his term has expired? The one who has complete control over senate, the courts, and now the banks? The one hiding in plain sight. Palpatine.

The first thing to change would be that instead of dueling with Ahsoka, Maul orders his forces to surrender. Ahsoka pretends to have captured Maul and brings him to whatever prison they have. This change means that the Battle of Mandalore ends much quicker and they can leave much sooner. Ahsoka, Rex and Maul (in handcuffs) leave at dawn on Mandalore. Maul is kept in a cell (to keep up the charade), but Ahsoka slips him a communicator so she can talk to him. 

Ahsoka would tell Rex about the Chancellor and Rex would match her with his own revelation. Brain implants, in the clones, every clone. He brings up the recording of Fives and says that if the Chancellor is compromised they should remove them all to be safe. They then order the entire crew of the ship to head to the medbay to begin removing their chips.

Mace Windu: ""Thank You commander. Anakin deliver this report to the Chancellor his reaction will give us a clue to his intentions""

Windu: ""Miss Tano, have you captured Maul yet?""

Ahsoka: ""Yes master, and I have discovered a terrible revelation.""

Windu: ""What have you learned?""

Ahsoka: ""The Chancellor is a Sith Lord.""

Windu: ""A Sith Lord?!""

Anakin: ""The one we've looking for!""

Windu: ""And how do you know this?""

Anakin: ""Ahsoka what is the meaning of this?""

Maul: ""So you are Skywalker. I must say I'm not impressed, although I do see the potential""

Maybe this is a dumb question but I'm a little confused about the 'balance to the force' part of the prophesy.  If Qui-Gon knew Anakin was a ""vergence"" in the Force, what did he think that meant? Did Qui-Gon know Anakin was going to level the ranks of the Jedi? Two Siths to two Jedi (plus a few scattered throughout the galaxy)? Did he believe the prophesy was a 'done deal'?"

As so in the phantom menace when Qui gon Jin tried to use the trick on Anakin’s owner. It failed as he supposedly had a strong mind. But since Anakin has a very high midi chlorian count he could use it on strong minds as well, as we can see in the attack of the attack of the clones; Anakin asks his old owner is he knows where his mother is, it does not work the first time but the second time he responds giving the location of where his mother lives. Even if Padme had a strong mind he would still be able to use the Jedi mind trick on her. So if Anakin did it unconsciously or knowing he was doing it, there is a very high chance he was. One of the reasons was because of their giant age difference. Anakin was only a little boy when Padme was around 15-20."

872,1601840765.0,StarWarsTheories,"THEORYS OF MINE FOR STAR WARS - Movie theories:

Future:

New resistance seasons (rumors) 

Rewrite of sequels?  (Rumors) 

Past:

Old republic movies (rumor) 

Obi wan show can't wait!! (Confirmed) 

season 2 mandalorian!! (Unsure on if still doing it but confirmed) 

More seasons to rebels rumors??? Or Ezra bridger / Rebels Movie (Rumor)

Darth vader show/movie (rumor) 

Yoda movie (rumor) 

Let me know if the rumors of these are true or not please.

Character future theories:

Ezra Bridger should most likely be an adult by the era of first order’s defeat and is said to be alive

Baby yoda will be an adult or at least an older teen-ager? And he should have a decent name by now(instead of the child...). Hopefully trained by Ahsoka Tano the master jedi who might be alive in future movies but I honestly don't think so due to age. 

Anakin Skywalker confirmed alive by George lucas when rewriting sequels, who will hopefully bring his Skywalker title back to life meaning that's another jedi returned. And Anakin as well might bring Luke and Leia may be alive and not be killed in sequels when george re writes them and possibly leia but not rlly bc carrie fisher sadly died (rest in peace). sadly but fortunately. Anakin may as well bring obi wan Kenobi and yoda back to life somehow but maybe just obi wan or just yoda… I can't see George Lucas bringing back the whole crew… Unless??? 

So possibly yoda and/or obi wan, baby yoda, Luke Skywalker, possibly Leia Skywalker, possibly Ahsoka Tano, Ezra Bridger, possibly Ben solo(after kylo rens childish empire remake if george still makes that happen). 

OTHER THEORIES:
Jacen Syndulla SON of kanan Jarrus / Caleb dume and Hera syndulla from star wars rebels might be alive still and could possibly be trained by Ezra, Ahsoka, or Luke somehow??? Because we saw him in rebels but didn't get to see his power… BUT there is a theory (based on legends comics. Leia and han solo have 2 kids named jacen and jaina, both trained by luke as jedi and jacen turns to darth caedus and is killed by jaina and then jaina dies later on somehow and this might be canon VERSION of that but different circumstances, parents, last names, species) that he has a sister who killed him as a jedi trained by Luke (like Jacen Solo) before Jacen turned to the dark side and became Darth Caedus. Though if Jaina isn’t the sister of Jacen then she is another Jedi somehow in the universe which will be learned eventually. So if Jacen actually does not have a sister and this is false it means he is still alive somehow some way meaning possibly trained by ezra or luke or rey or just dies not being a jedi at all raised as another life purpose by hera his mother.

There's a theory that Obi-Wan Kenobi and Anakin Skywalker (darth Vader) both had a child with Padme. Anakin's children in the movies were Luke and Leia, but there's a strong Theory that suggests Obi-Wan had an affair with Padme that made Leia Obi-Wan Kenobi's daughter and Luke Anakin's son meaning they have the same mom and different dad making them half-siblings. Also because Rey the kylo ren movies was supposed to be a Kenobi would have made Rey Kenobi's granddaughter and Princess Leia's daughter with Han Solo. The clues behind this are very obvious actually, because (clue 1) when Obi-Wan Kenobi went into hiding to watch Luke and train him as a Jedi his identity name was Ben Kenobi, and kylo Ren's real name is Ben Skywalker, So Leia named kylo Ren after her real dad's false name. Also ( clue 2) is that Leia and Han Solo don't have the English accent that Obi-Wan Kenobi did so Rey must have inherited that from her grandfather which skipped Leia and went to Rey. Also(clue 3) Luke and Anakin both fought with their emotion and tried to bite off more than they can chew, Leia was not like this and was a leader and thought about what she did before doing them which helps the Rebellion win which is what Obi-Wan Kenobi did as a Jedi, and because Rey was trained by Luke she used her emotion as well but she also thought about things and was a leader also from her mother and grandfather Leia and Obi Wan. Also (clue 4 ) is that when Darth Vader met Leia for the first time on the Rebellion Cruiser this is why he didn't sense that it was his supposed daughter because it actually wasn't his daughter but instead his niece since him and Obi-Wan Kenobi were like brothers Before Anakin turns into Darth Vader. Also (clue 5) when luke tells leia that they are siblings she says she has always somehow known, and when obi wan has visions in the force learning he has a brother (anakins half brother on tatooine) and this could have been what leia had gone through, because she was force sensitive. Also kylo Ren lied a lot to his enemies to get their minds confused and scatterbrained so he could use them for whatever knowledge and power he wanted to defeat the resistance, plus because he could have possibly knew about this, it made him more evil and more angry and wanted to kill more people due to him mocking his supposed grandfathers empire and army of evil when its not even his grand father and he's just feeding his own alter ego, and this could be the reason Leia chose not to be a jedi, is that she got a force vision of her real father and when hearing the name in the vision as well as from luke she could have gotten curious and asked luke and got her answer but keeping it a secret from her half brother so in the movies 7 8 + 9 right now Rey could actually still be a Kenobi and just thinks she is the daughter of Palpatine's failed clone of himself, but thank God George Lucas is rewriting the movies because he will actually do it correctly and show this most likely so even though this is a theory Rey still is a Kenobi somehow, also making Ben solo a kenobi as well and making rey and ben siblings hoping they still don't fall in love like jj abrams attempted to do 3 times...  If leia isnt obi wans daughter then the kid satine had secretley in clone wars could be his secretly and no one besides them knew so he could be reys father.

George lucas rewriting the sequels he also said he would reincarnate Anakin Skywalker, as a Jedi again, or possibly grey jedi with my previous theory due to grey jedi either using only light or dark or both for their own reasons, and because he could have used the dark to reincarnate themself. Also if George Lucas keeps luke alive instead of the horrible way JJ abrams killed him this could mean Luke, ben and Anakin if reincarnated are the last pure blood skywalkers.

Han solo connected to the force? In the rise of skywalker episode 9 we see han solos ghost talk to kylo ren, and not just any person can be a ghost in star wars so this means han solo was force sensitive but did not know until after death and luke possibly telling him and now learning to use it for the better to speak to his son one final time before either fully seducing the dark or returning to the light as anakin had.

Finn being force sensitive is good and i cannot wait to see it but from who? There are three insane theories of this, either mace windu survived order 66 somehow someway and met some female lover who we will learn hopefully and having a baby boy named Finn. If that is not the case then, possibly Lando calrissian when flirting with princess leia had a affair and kept it secret from han before leia and han officially got together making him rey and ben’s half brother sharing mother but not father, and that is why finn does not know anything about himself besides his numbers in first order, gender obviously and appearance and why he is sent to the first order, being either abducted and trained or rescued and slaved to be a troop until he agreed. And if that is not it then, he is still lando calrissian's or mace windus son somehow, but lando must have met a force sensitive women and had finn with her who was either sith or jedi, either way we will learn who she is and if this is true.

There is a theory that poe dameron, and one of his now dead parents is and was force sensitive. Now only this being a theory about his parents, in a comic series issue 27(idk which one) it does confirm HE indeed is force sensitive so, could he be another future jedi? Or just ignore his power and continue his life, because he is a bit old to learn now. And my personal theory is that, since he is such a showoff and is very pushy he could attempt to learn and be the future sith lord because he can not understand the force as everyone else does and is always pushy and wants his enemies to be defeated instantly instead of having patience.

Sabine Wren in Star Wars Clone Wars finds the darksaber with Ezra and Kanan, when Kanan attempts train her in combat we later on find out she is indeed force-sensitive so she could possibly in the future be trained by Ezra or someone to be a Jedi and help start the Jedi Order as well as being a Mandalorian.

Jar Jar Binks secretly Sith Lord the gungan who we don't know what happened to could possibly still be alive due to his species being able to live 65 years, so if he is still alive by time Rey is born he could be a help in the future Sith Lord or generally since the Sith Lord abandoned him with many others. But no one appreciated this so i dont rlly know..

General hux the abused by kylo Ren character is actually for sensitive which means if he wanted kylo Ren to be defeated so bad and teamed with the resistance like in the movies he could help everyone start the new Jedi Order if he is trained correctly if he wants. Or he could be a sith lord like kylo except in his own way ruling the galaxy 'correctly' in his pov.

Jedi order for future
So knowing that Rey, Anakin, Luke, Ahsoka, POSSIBLY yoda, POSSIBLY obi wan, Finn, sabine, poe and hux if they want to be trained, Ezra, Baby yoda, and Jacen Syndulla, create the Jedi order for the future of the galaxy and the new galactic republic, and after doing so Rey and Anakin will possibly use the dark side as well creating the grey jedi may or may not joined by ezra and baby yoda but not for sure of either of these things.

Sith Order
General grievous possibility.. He was a droid so what if somehow palpatine had his memory chip and is in one of his empire wastelands and can be re entered into a new body? (But palpatine would have been definatley dead after vader killing him in return of the jedi said by george lucas)
Inquisitors may still be alive from the empire in star wars rebels… They… they might Recreate the sith order as well, Buuuut I don't see it happening but if it did it would be cool.
Poe because of theory above possibility, hux because of above theory possiblity as well.

Grey jedi
Together Rey Skywalker/kenobi, Baby Yoda, ahsoka and Anakin Skywalker will create the Grey Jedi Order....? That's possible and I hope for it!! Ezra Bridger due to the interaction with maul May be a grey jedi even though he didn't know what it was but not for sure."
873,1601830305.0,StarWarsTheories,"What if Maul killed Obi Wan and Qui Gon? - Naboo, 32 BBY, The Duel of The Fates. Maul killed Qui Gon and has Obi Wan disarmed. However, instead of Maul exercising a large amount of arrogance, he finishes his kill. Obi Wan is force pushed down the reactor shaft before he can cut Maul in half.

Now, Anakin no longer has either of the two people that would actually be willing to train him, as the council made it very clear that he was too old to become a Jedi. so bam, end of story, no Darth Vader, and the Galaxy is saved, right? Wrong. Dooku, while not a Jedi at the time, may step up to the task. Dooku had left the Order three years prior to Qui Gon's death, but kept in contact with his old Padawan up until the events on Naboo. His old friend Sifo Dyas informs him of the tragedy on Naboo, and that a boy who Qui Gon claimed was The Chosen One has now lost any hopes of being trained. Dooku, now knowing from his friend that Anakin's midi-chlorian count is higher than Master Yoda's himself, realizes that this opportunity is too good to pass up.  Dooku realizes that Yoda won't let ""The Chosen One"" be trained by just anyone. Knowing this, Dooku goes to his old Master, and asks to be reinstated into the Order. Yoda approves, because Yoda knows that no one else would step up to training Anakin. Of course, he is hesitant to allow Dooku to carry on Anakin's training, but he doesn't have many other options. End of story, Dooku, against Yoda's better judgement, ends up training Anakin. (In this alternate timeline, Dooku is accepted back on to the council, so please avoid any comments correcting my decision on how this specific part would play out. Feel free to share an opinion on who you else think may have trained Anakin though).

So what happens regarding the clones? Everything regarding the clone army stays the same, except Sifo Dyas is never killed by the Pykes on Dooku's order, meaning that Sifo Dyas is able to come collect the army on time. Obviously, Dyas would be kicked from the Order for going against the Jedi's direct orders not to make an army. The Geonoshian battle wouldn't happen, because Obi Wan isn't alive to chase Jango Fett from Kamino to Geonosis, which begs the question of: How do the clones get approved by the Senate? Well, a different first battle has to occur. In this timeline, after Sifo Dyas is kicked off the Order permanently, Maul receives orders to assassinate Sifo Dyas. The assassination is staged as if Dyas attacked Maul first, because Maul needs to keep his appearance clean as the leader of the Separatists. Maul defeats Sifo Dyas easily, and supposedly acquires information that an army is being created on the planet of Kamino (obviously, Maul acquired this information from Palpatine, but his cover-up is that Sifo Dyas had given it up before his death. Not from torturing Dyas, but maybe like Dyas says ""You can't even comprehend what is about to happen. A cloning facility right now is making an army and you will be defeated"". Obviously, this is shady and makes the Separatist movement a little sus, but the people buy it, and the upcoming battle is fairly justified (at least in the Separatist's eyes). In conclusion, an attack on Kamino is launched by Maul, and was approved by the Senate of The Confederacy of Independent systems. This battle gives the galaxy it's first look at the droid army (who is attacking Kamino) and the clone army. After this battle occurs, Palpatine is granted emergency powers and approves the army. Now you may be asking, what happens regarding Padme and Anakin?

&#x200B;

Well, essentially, the same thing happens. Palps gives Maul the order to assassinate Padme due to her disapproval of the Military Creation Act. Maul fails the first time, and ends up killing Corde, who was posing as Padme, in the explosion. This, in turn, convinces the Jedi that Padme needs a security detail while on Coruscant. Dooku and Anakin are assigned. The events play out the same here, and Anakin has rediscovered his love for Padme. Now, instead of the shapeshifter attempting to assassinate Padme, Cad Bane is hired by Maul. Keep in mind that in TCW, Cad Bane is hired by Sidious himself, meaning that Cad is on Sidious' radar. Cad Bane, however, fails, but instead of being captured by the jedi, he manages to escape Coruscant. Everything regarding Anakin's mother also stays the same, and Anakin still slaughters the tribe of tusken raiders, implying that even Dooku isn't able to help Anakin control his anger. This is why a Jedi can't have any relationships, and why he was too old. His relationship with his mom, even in this alternate universe, is what gives us the first glimpse at Darth Vader. 

Anakin's bond with Palpatine is also growing, except in this universe, it's even stronger. Palpatine knows that Anakin is training under Dooku, and he also knows that Dooku's ideas are too radical for the Council. This causes a prejudice within the Council, meaning neither Anakin nor Dooku are trusted. Palpatine is able to use this to his advantage, and I will elaborate on this later on. For now, let's talk about Anakin's training. Anakin is essentially being trained by one of the most powerful Jedi to have ever existed. His knowledge of the force is much greater than it would have been if he had trained under Obi Wan or even Qui Gon. His dueling skills are also significantly better, as Dooku is training him to fight using Form II. All in all, Dooku is helping Anakin to achieve his full potential, which is something Obi Wan never could do

However, Anakin was nearing his prime, and Palpatine needed a new apprentice. Regarding the war, everything is playing out to Palpatine's advantage, similar to how it was in the normal timeline. Elaborating on this would be redundant and make this college essay longer than it needs to be. Palpatine needed a way to kill Maul off, and have Anakin take his place. First, Anakin had to feel as if the Jedi were corrupt. So, Palps did what any sane person would do. He had taken advantage of none other than Barriss Offee, who already had a hatred for the Jedi thanks to the cold hearted teaching of Luminara Unduli. Barriss becomes a spy for Palpatine, and eventually, an assassin. Dooku was murdered by Barris in his sleep, and his body was found with a singular lightsaber wound through his heart. Anakin was enraged. He had lost the closest thing he had to a father, and it almost hurt him as much as the death of his mother. Palpatine was the only person Anakin truly had besides Padme, and Palpatine had been filling Anakin's mind with thoughts of a corrupt Council from the start. Anakin has been getting the same dreams of Padme dying in childbirth as he was in the real timeline, and of course, Palpatine was behind them. The murder of Dooku was never solved, and Anakin continued to believe that it was the Jedi, and that they killed him because of his radical ideas regarding the war. Palpatine realized that this was now his time to shine. He essentially brain washed Anakin in the same sense, and told him that the dark side was the only way to save Padme. Palpatine also told Anakin that, through the force, Palps sensed that the Order plans to kill Anakin as well, and this, somehow, pushes Anakin over edge. This is a different Anakin though. This is full potential Anakin. The Jedi are spread out across the galaxy in essentially the same way they were, with the exception of Obi Wan and Grevious (Grevious doesn't exist in this timeline, because he was never saved by Sifo Dyas' blood). Anakin, under Sidious' order, purges the temple, except this time he kills Windu, Agen Kolar, Fisto, and Tinn while they were there as well. Anakin is full potential throughout this battle, and the only thing on his mind is avenging Dooku. No Jedi leaves the temple alive. Order 66 is declared, and the Jedi are essentially extinct. Palpatine now sends Anakin to finish off the Separatists, first by killing off Maul, and then by shutting down the droid army and assassinating any Separatist leader (locations were given by Palpatine, obviously). Palpatine now self inflicts wounds onto his body, and explains that the Jedi Order was corrupt and attempted to kill him. Now, he announces the new Galactic Empire, and guess what? He is greeted with cheers. 

Padme is killed by Palpatine through the force (as she is in the movie), but not before having her heart broken. Yoda, one of the only surviving Jedi, tells her that Anakin is no longer the same man that she knew, and that he has purged the Jedi. Padme lets out a small gasp after pushing the last twin out, and in that final breath, she faintly says ""Leia"". Obviously Luke has already been named. This would be her dying breath. Yoda leaves with the babies, and decides to watch over Leia, while giving Luke to the Lars family. Palpatine later enters the building and drives a lightsaber through Padmes chest. When Anakin comes home, he sees Padme dead, with a deep wound in her chest. He thinks back to any Jedi in his mind, and of course, the only one he can think of is Yoda. Anakin is filled with rage and immediately begins his own personal hunt for Yoda, until one night, Vader is summoned by Palpatine. Palpatine tells Vader that his search for Yoda is pointless, as Yoda is obviously hidden extremely well, except Palps says this in the most insincere way possible. Vader immediately begins crushing Palpatine's throat with the force, and this is before Palps began creating clones. Vader eventually kills Palpatine, becoming the new Emperor of the galaxy.

Vader obviously isn't immortal, so he begins purging the galaxy in search for his child. Eventually, he feels something, something strange, so he follows his feeling. This takes him to Tatooine, and there, he finds none other than his step family. He slaughters them all, besides Luke, and burns the house to the ground. Luke, still a toddler, maybe 3-4 years old, is completely clueless to what's going on. 

Vader proceeds to train Luke, and teaches him that the Empire are the good guys. Luke believes Vader for his whole life, until he went with Vader to the countless planets destroyed or enslaved by the Empire. Luke immediately realizes that his whole life has been a lie, and attempts to kill Vader. Vader, who has no idea what has caused such a violent spur in Luke, pushes him back with the force. Vader shrugs the incident off like it was nothing, which was a big mistake. Luke continues his attack, except this time he creeps up silently, and when he gets right near Anakin, Anakin turns around, but only to see the ignition of a red lightsaber. Anakin's head tumbles to the floor, and Luke, being the predecessor, disbands the Empire, and single handedly transforms it into the New Republic

&#x200B;

Some details I may have left out: Anakin never becomes a cyborg, and he reaches his full potential. Padme's pregnancy had begun before Dooku's death. Leia grows up without any association to Luke or Vader. A rebellion is never formed, because Vader at full potential single handedly wiped out any spark of a rebellion, meaning he not only killed the rebels, but also their neighbors, their families, their homes.

&#x200B;

I know there's some loose ends and it isn't the most thorough theory ever, but in short, in this alternate timeline, if Maul had killed Obi Wan and Qui Gon, then the universe would be a lot worse than what it turned out to be. (only according to this alternate timeline. I'm not saying that if Maul had actually killed Obi Wan Dooku would train Anakin, because that does seem a little unlikely. I thought it was just an interesting timeline) 

&#x200B;

Feel free to tie up any loose ends if you'd like, ask questions about what would've happened to certain characters, or point out any flaws to the timeline that I could fix. Again, this is as brief as I could make it without writing a full on book"

Or has he just forgot it along the way of his old war torn path? Also does R2 remember Darth as Anakin?
875,1601747081.0,StarWarsTheories,"There’s a fan theory about how The Child from The Mandalorian and Anakin Skywalker were suppose to be a Force Dyad. - If that is try and they did become a Force Dyad then that means the Chosen One Prophecy needs a Force Dyad to come true. The Force Dyads could be Anakin and The Child, Luke and Leia, and Kylo Ren and Rey. Each one fulfilled the Chosen One Prophecy in one way or another."
876,1601420932.0,StarWarsTheories,"How the Empire would explain the events of ROTS to the public. - This theory would explain what the empire would tell it’s citizens in universe about the events of ROTS. 

Obviously we begin with Palpatine being captured by Grevious above Coroscant. The Empire would try to spin it in a way that would spin it to make it seem like the Jedi allowed Palpatine to be captured and coordinated this attack with Dooku. 

Important note: Even though the Jedi Order would be discredited, Anakin Skywalker would still be a hero to the Empire. I’ll come back to this later. 

The story would go that Anakin kills Dooku but Obi Wan Kenobi allows Grevious to escape to Utapau. 

Anakin would be portrayed as the only Jedi loyal to the republic (except for the inquisitors later)

And since the Jedi Council is corrupt and unaccountable to the public, it would send the same person that allowed Grevious to escape in the first place to go arrest him on Utapau: Obi Wan Kenobi. And you might be wondering why they didn’t send Anakin, the man who killed Dooku to also go arrest/kill Grevious. Well the Jedi has other plans for Skywalker. 

It would be revealed to the public that the Council tried to use Anakin to spy on the Chancellor. Although Anakin would reveal this to Palpatine thus cementing his loyalty to the Republic and not the Jedi. 

On Utapau, Kenobi warns The Separatist Council of the upcoming attack and let’s them escape to Mustafar. But loyal troops of the 212th would kill Grevious and attempt to kill the traitor Kenobi as well but they failed. 

Palpatine, having discovered the location of the Separatists on Mustafar from Republic spies, would dispatch Skywalker to arrest/kill them. Knowing the Jedi’s treachery, neither Anakin nor Palpatine told the Council so that they could catch the separatists by surprise. 

Since the attempted kidnapping failed and the end of the war was coming soon, the treacherous Jedi would have to act fast to overthrow the Republic. Mace Windu and 4 other Jedi would attempt to assassinate Palpatine in his office. 

Note: I don’t know how to explain Vader. Nobody does. In canon he just shows up in the Empire without any proper explanation and there’s a whole comic arc about high ranking imperials being pissed about it. I got nothing he just shows up. 

Vader defends the Chancellor from the Jedi and kills all 4 of them. Not before the Jedi severely disfigure Palpatine. 

Now that the Jedi have truly revealed themselves as the traitorous rats they are, Palpatine has to retaliate. Order 66 is called all over the galaxy to arrest the Jedi or kill them if necessary. Vader however would lead the 501st to secure the Temple. Jedi in the temple had the offer to swear loyalty to Republic or die. Most of them died. 

Palpatine would give his now famous declaration  to create the Empire. Meanwhile Anakin would deactivate the droid army and singlehandedly end the war. 

After Obi Wan and Master Yoda survive their attempted arrests, they rendezvous and attack the Jedi Temple. Theirs motives for doing this are unknown but they would hatch a plan. Their final act of Rebellion. 

Yoda would attempt his own assassination on Palpatine but Vader would prevent this again. With Yoda even destroying the Senate, the symbol of freedom in the Empire. 

Obi Wan meanwhile would kidnap the pregnant Senator Padme Amidala to use as leverage against Skywalker. The events that took place on Mustafar are unknown but there was extensive damage to the station, Anakin Skywalker would be found dead, Obi Wan Kenobi is missing, and Senator Amidala’s body would be discovered by her friend Senator Bail Organa at the Polis Massa medical station. Her funeral would be held on Naboo. 

Several Jedi still remain at large, but the Empire will work tirelessly to try to make the Galaxy a safe a secure place for all. 

TLDR: Fascist revisionism of a PG-13 movie"

How concious do you guys Vader (or rather Anakin within Vader) was after Ahsoka sliced his helmet during Twilight of the Apprentice? How does this compare to Anakin's presence within Vader post-ROTS, for example as seen in TCW finale.

Honestly, prior to TCW series, I was never a big fan of how Anakin and his fall was handled by Lucas, don't get me wrong I am far from a prequel hater but I do think it could have been executed in a much better manner. TCW reedemed that character in my eyes and made both Anakin and Ahsoka my all time favourites."
878,1601327908.0,StarWarsTheories,"Dexter Jettster is Pong Krell - This is probably one of the weirdest theories yet but bare with me. I’ll start with the obvious. Dex and Krell are the same species. Also, the timeline checks out. Dex is friends with Obi-wan and in Umbara, Krell is in communication with Krell almost the whole time. Now let’s get to the unheard of stuff. How did Dex know that the dart in Episode II was from the cloners in kamino? He must’ve been there before. We know the kaminoans were in contact with Dooku. We also know that the kaminoans were sabotaging the clones using chips for order 66. Who is to say that they didn’t like clones? Me. The kaminoans were eager to kill Tupp which could mean that they probably wanted to kill more clones. They probably didn’t care enough to even try to fix clones that were not doing good. Now back to Dex, he was probably at Kamino (the reason he knows of the dart) which means he knows clones. He was probably working with the kaminoans who ordered him to go undercover as a Jedi and kill clones. Also, Krell said himself he is not a separatist. The time periods are also gave Dex time to lose weight. I could go on and on. In conclusion, I think Dexter Jettster and Pong Krell are the same person. Thank you for reading my theory."
879,1601277384.0,StarWarsTheories,"The Lord of Hunger - Ok, hear me out here. I know Nihilus gets a lot of hate because he’s so overrated, but imagine a new storyline (legends or canon) where Nihilus’ mask and robes are dug up by a “Grey Jedi” who decides to visit Malachore in search of knowledge of the Dark Side. Now, for those who might not know, Nihilus had to trap his soul in his mask and robes because he consumed so many midi-chlorians that his body literally began deteriorating into the force. The movie or book would basically be this “Grey Jedi” (for those of you who don’t know what a Grey Jedi is it’s basically a Jedi who kind of shifts more to the dark side than the light) donning Nihilus’ soul and acting as a host for him, which in turn reawakens his hunger for Midi-Chlorians. The protagonist could easily be Luke, considering he has countless adventures across the galaxy after the Battle of Yavin. Idk if this fits into the alternate timeline category but like a horror themed Star Wars movie revolving around Nihilus receiving a host body and purging planets for force energy just seems like such a cool concept.

Every single member of his race we have ever seen in cannon or legends (to my knowledge) is strong in the force.  What if, thousands of years before the battle of Yavin, the Jedi (Yoda’s race) were the first light side force wielders in the galaxy.  Or even just the first force users in general.  Then they explored the rest of the galaxy to find beings like them to train, thus starting the Jedi order.  And what is the home planet of this race you might ask?

882,1600895235.0,StarWarsTheories,"TV Show Brainstorm - I want to go through a couple of tv shows (confirmed, rumoured, and hopeful) and state what I hope happens in them

**Confirmed**

Mandalorian Season 2-We already have the plot of the show, with Din Djarin trying to find the Jedi. Hopefully, we get more of Gideon and this remnant Imperial group to maybe form the future First Order. Hopefully see some Ahsoka and Sabine, but I don't think we will get that conclusion to the Jedi search just yet (rumors for a season 4). Maybe some fun stuff with Cobb and Rex. My main goal is to see some good lightsaber battles in this one, making it the first good lightsaber battle since Revenge of the Sith. More Darksaber, background on Gideon

Kenobi- I want to see some old foes and old friends return. Maybe Cad Bane returning for vengeance. Maybe a Korkie and Ahsoka appearance? I honestly don't know when we will see Rosario Dawson, bc apparently she has already filmed some scenes besides Mando 2, when her own show hasn't been confirmed.

Cassian Andor-IDK what to expect, but I want some different parts of Star Wars explored. Maybe some Fest backstory. I think I've had my share of the Empire

Bad Batch- I just wan't clones. Rex, Cody, Boil, Appo, and of the course the Batch. Want them fighting the empire, maybe becoming bounty hunters. Some intragroup fighting, that eventually culminates in them fighting some big baddie gangster, like maybe the Son-Tuul Pride, the Black Sun, or maybe early version of the Crimson Dawn.

**Rumored**

Rebels Sequel- Ok , so I don't know whether or not it is animated or live action, but it looks like it will be something. Ahsoka and Sabine search for Ezra, and then finally find him in the Unknown regions, stuck in the middle of a war. I know this has been leaked, but it would be awesome if this dived deep into the depths of star wars lore. Hopefully, it is animated, but then I don't know when/ an Ahsoka series would be about. 

Now, they also mention that a Rebels series will be a series with all the Phoenixes coming back together. IDK how that would work. Hera is (supposedly) working for the New Republic and Zeb is in a planet beyond the outer rim. So how would they get back together? Maybe Ahsoka and Sabine ask Hera and Zeb for help once they realize that Ezra is in over his head, and they also want to show him that Thrawn, who is now his ally, is deceiving him.

Ahsoka Series- Lets assume the Rebels sequel is animated. What is Ahsoka's series about then? I think, it could be a leadup into finding Ezra, with Sabine still at her side, searching the galaxy. Think of it as planet hopping, going from planet to planet, and then making some very unexpected friends and enemies on the way.

Maul Series: Prob will be about him and Qira leading a criminal empire. I refuse to believe that Qira has any redeeming qualities, so hopefully we see her and Maul become these pseudo protagonist villains fighting the rebels and the empire at every turn. I want a death, so give me a Qira death at the end.

Windu- Give me some Cyslin and some Depa. Depa is one of the more influencial characters on the Jedi Order that we learn little about. Want to learn more about her, and how Mace became so angry and annoying all the time lol. Give me purple saber backstory, and maybe some Galactic Republic history, as we didn't get enough of that during the prequels.

**Hopeful**

Female Centric Series: Ok, I don't think this is Rey, bc that would be weird that they would say female centric when it was the female hero that we've followed for so long. I don't think its rey, and my pitch for this Female Centric Series centers around two people. Doctor Aphra and Barriss Offee.

Most people know that a rumored Doctor Aphra show is in development, but my pitch for Barriss is actually personal. I always wanted to see Offee show up somewhere after Order 66, having maybe been offered a role as a leading Inquisitor but then escaping bc of her hate for the Dark Side (IDT she is a dark side user, just disillusioned by the Jedi Order).

One or the other. I realize Aphra is more likely, so maybe we see Offee in Bad Batch or something like that. I just want a story around her. She wasn't really sith, and she ended up being correct.

Old Republic Series- After the films/ trilogy of the old republic are confirmed and produced and filmed maybe some tv shows centered around characters from the tv shows."
883,1600870147.0,StarWarsTheories,"A chiss connection - So, hear me out. We know that the force sensitive children that the chiss ascendancy had were called the skywalkers. Their primary purpose was to navigate the chaos, (the word for unknown regions in the chiss language). So what if a long time, i mean a really long time ago, one of the forefathers of the skywalker family was lost in the unknown space and was found by the chiss. Maybe his parents were killed in some deep space accident and only one survived till they get out of hyperspace. So, maybe this chiss found the child and then took him under their care and then when the child started to show some force powers, they gave the child the title of Skywalker. Then after some generations, one of the descendants of the original skywalker went out of the ascendacy into the republic and changed his last name to a basic translation to the last name that he had and became the first 'skywalker'"
884,1600726223.0,StarWarsTheories,"Boba Fett will NOT be in Mando season 2...or maybe he will. - Here’s my thought, the person we see in Mandalorian Season 2 is may be the real Boba Fett or maybe it’s someone posing as Boba Fett and using his reputation for their gain. 

Because the Clones were created off of Jengo Fett. There’s millions of clones that look just like Boba.   The show may even keep it ambiguous and never fully answering whether it is or not. Keeping us all guessing."
885,1600721902.0,StarWarsTheories,"Captain Rex Promotion - I speculate that Rex’s promotion to “commander” was simply a temporary field promotion.

During the American Civil War, officers died frequently. To replace them with professionally trained officers during the middle of a campaign would have been difficult. The brevet system allowed for lower ranking soldiers (mostly junior commissioned officers, but occasionally non-commissioned officers) to be promoted to a higher rank. This was a temporary promotion which would allow the army to function in the event that a senior officer died.

In Rex’s case, Anakin need to divide his troops and in order for Rex to command a larger unit size without another senior officer (such as General Skywalker), Rex need a promotion to “commander.” This temporary promotion would have given him the authority to command half of the 501 Legion. It would also explain why Rex refers to himself as a captain in Rebels. If my theory is correct, then, technically, he was only a Bvt. commander, not a full commander. While there are other reasons as to why he might not refer to himself as commander, such as his respect for Asoka (her being the former commander of the 501) and painful memories associated with his brief stint as “commander,,” in military terms, however, Rex could never see himself as a commander because he never was one."
886,1600718760.0,StarWarsTheories,"Sith Possession - In TROS, it’s either implied or outright stated that if Rey kills Palpatine he will posses her or merge consciousness or something like that. My theory basically says that what if this is what Sith Masters did with their apprentices. Going all the way back to Darth Bane, the Sith would find a very powerful force user and train them and then their apprentices kill them. But by doing this their master possesses their body and gains their power. The Sith do this for a thousand years and now you basically have a comically powerful Sith Lord with Wisdom going back generations. This is why Palpatine says he is all the Sith, a part of his predecessors live inside him. (Similar to One For All from MHA if anyone is familiar). That’s why Palpatine only wanted Anakin, Luke, or Rey and no one else. He senses that they were the only ones powerful enough to be deemed worthy to continue the Sith Legacy. This could also explain why Palpatine decided to have children. Since Vader was no longer a viable candidate after Mustafar and there were no others powerful enough, Palpatine decided to father his own replacement. 

TLDR: When Sith apprentices kill their masters, their masters posses them so in some way every Sith is Darth Bane."
887,1600621230.0,StarWarsTheories,"Padmé’s Death - So we all love to joke about Padmé Amidala dying because of “sadness,” however I have really thought about it and made my own answer for her true cause of death. 

After watching the sequels/mando, I started to look into force healing and how it works according to lore and legend since there isn’t much canon evidence. The premise is that powerful force wielders can move the life force from one life source to the next.

As Revenge of the Sith concludes, we know that Anakin is on the verge of death because of the injuries he sustained from is duel with Obi-wan since he didn’t understand the high ground was such an advantage. 

My theory is that Emperor Palpatine uses this force trait to suck the life force out of Padmé to save Anakin. This would keep Anakin (or rather Darth Vader) focused on the task of being a Sith apprentice rather than raising a family. It also kept Anakin alive. The emperor benefited in two ways if this is the case. 

Let me hear your thoughts and other theories pertaining to this topic."

During the first one in particular, while Rey is meditating on the rock, she essentially learns a balance between light and dark is necessary. Between everything from life to death, peace to violence is the Force that binds it all together. The Force does not belong to the Jedi (or the Sith, for that matter) and just because they no longer exist doesn't mean the light has completely vanished. It's natural to take bits and pieces from both sides; one of the Jedi's shortcomings was their complete suppression of emotions, but it was Luke's love for his father that brought Anakin back to the light. Redemption never occurred to Yoda or Obi-Wan, who withheld the truth from Luke as they trained him in the Jedi ways."

I'm nearly certain the endgame for The Mandalorian will be Din Djarin wielding the Darksaber and becoming the new Mandalore. 

We already know Rey is now the new keeper of the Jedi tradition. 

The Child is already serving as the bridge between the Mandalorians and the Jedi. If the rumors are true, and the Jedi that Djarin finds is Ahsoka, and the three form an alliance, then it will be the beginning of a new era and hopefully the end of the rivalry between the Jedi and the Mandalorians.

If Djarin, Ahsoka, and the Child survive past the sequels, they likely will encounter Rey. Ahsoka will offer her assistance to Rey in reforging a new Jedi order, which the Child will be a part of. If the Child is a part of it, Djarin will be involved. ""Wherever I go, he goes."" 

Since this alliance will already be formed, and the Galaxy will be entering a time of cleansing and peace, I could see the new Jedi Order and the new Mandalorians, each respectively led by good natured individuals, forming a pact to keep peace throughout the Galaxy.

I doubt that we'll get any stories set after the ST for years, but it seems like the seeds for this potentiality are all there.

My theory is that this is Hedala or even Miara. These are both characters from the book Ashoka. Hedala I believe was about 5 years old in the book and miara was I think roughly 13. Hedala could be a young Jedi in training, Ashoka  in the book always tries to protect hedala even at her own risk. An example of this is when she has to leave raada she goes to the Fardis, even after she had already stolen from them. Because she wants to make sure hedala is safe. I think we can assume that as hedala grew up Ahsoka kept her eye on Hedala and her force powers so she wouldn’t reveal those powers. In the end of the book she joins bail organa’s rebellion and names herself fulcrum (which we see in rebels), at this point she brought miara with her to join the rebellion. This book is right after the finale of the clone wars so we know that the mandalorian is approximately 22 years after the events of Ahsoka. That means Hedala would be in her mid-late twenties and Miara her mid-late thirties.

Originally I thought that maybe The Child was influencing Din into helping him with the force. Odd that a bunch of weak minded pirates or mercs were protecting him when IG-11 and Din show up and then Din seems to suddenly become infatuated with protecting the little guy?
But then I started thinking: what if that's just what the living force wants and Din just happens to be more in tune with it than most?

Then there is the story itself. We dont know how Gideon ended up with the Darksaber, but it being part of the story also can't be a coincidence. While there's no guarantee that Din possessing it would mean a reunification of the Manalorians, him being force sensitive AND possessing it would mean the possibility is much more likely.

896,1600244230.0,StarWarsTheories,"The gritty city in the Mandalorian trailer is Coruscant. And the reason the Mandalorian is on Coruscant is that he's going to break into the ruins of the Jedi Temple. - So, the theory goes like this. And keep in mind, even if the planet isn't Coruscant, I still think the Mando will go there. Here's how and why:

The Mandalorian, after learning about the Jedi Temple, will travel to Coruscant and enter the Temple with the Child. The Child will be drawn, through the Force, to a secret location in the Temple containing something important for the Mandalorian. Either a secret Jedi vault or Palpatine's safe. Most likely, they'll find a Holocron containing a list that the Child will open for him. And this list will be the center of his journey for Season 2. Here's my reasons why I think this will happen, and what I think is on the list.

The Mandarlorian will learn about the Jedi Temple. He has to, the Temple is one of the most well-known places of the Jedi. So, it's the perfect starting place in his journey to search for the Jedi.

When the Temple fell, Palpatine converted it into his personal palace. And he stored the remanents of the Jedi Archives there. Archives full of information about the Jedi.

In Colin Treverow's original Episode IX script, one of the plots centered on Finn and Rose infiltrating the Jedi Temple. So, Dave Filoni and Jon Favreau might have taken this plot and altered it for the Mandalorian.

The reason why the Mando enters the ring is that he's looking for a guide. Presumably, the Temple is under control of the New Republic and heavily guarded, so the Mando needs to find a way to slip past the guards. Presumably, this way is through a secret passage underground, like Finn and Rose originally did. And he'll find this path in the Coruscant under levels. This would explain the squalid conditions of the city.

So, this list will contain one of two possibilities. Here's my theories and the evidence for both:

**Jedi Survivors:** A list of this is already confirmed to exist. In the Vader comics, the Inquisitors created a list for Vader that contained the names of all known survivors. So, the Mando finds the list and tries to track down the survivors on the list. This would explain why he returns to Tatooine, he's looking for information on Obi-Wan Kenobi and/or Luke Skywalker. As seen in the Vader comics, Mon Cala was also a refuge for surviving Jedi, so the Mando might be looking for another survivor. That may be who Sasha Banks is playing, either a Jedi survivor or the former Padawan of one, like Ezra Bridger.

**Planets:** The Jedi had at least three lists containing Force-sensitive children, so it would make sense that's they have at least one list containing planets important or sacred to the Jedi. The entirety of the Force Awakens centers on a map to the first Jedi Temple, and Kylo Ren mentions that the First Order has ""the rest"" scavenged from the Empire. This would explain how the Empire knew to mine Ilum and Jedha for Kyber crystals. Yoda's planet won't be one the list, but other prominent ones will be. If the ice planet in the trailer is Ilum, this would explain how the Mando learns about the planet."
897,1600222627.0,StarWarsTheories,"Obi Wan Kenobi did it! - So here’s my theory ... 
Obi Wan Kenobi killed Uncle Own and Auntie Beru. 
The whole point of R2-D2 landing right where it did, on a PLANET the size of Earth, was to get Luke into the fight. 
Old Ben (who was always R2’s real master) sent him there carrying the message to get him fired up, lead him off to ‘accidentally’ meet Obi Wan and fly off to Alderaan. 
The plan HAD been to give Luke the lightsaber, plant the seed of his father’s murder and then poach Luke when he was at the academy with Biggs, but grumpy Uncle Owen was holding him back ... he had to go. 
Luke needed a push and a massacre was just the ticket. 
Ben arranged the escape pod incident, got the Jawas to take the droids to Owen’s farm, had the Tuskens kill off the Jawas to cover their tracks (remember, the Sand People had a vendetta against Vader for his massacre of their camp) and then Obi Wan went off to kill Owen. 
Auntie Beru was just collateral. 
Luke called it when he said the Tuskens had killed the Jawas, but it was BEN who said that it could only be Imperials. 
Luke now believed that Imperial Troopers were going to go to his home and then believed that his family had been killed by them. 
The result was that he went from a reluctant farm boy with commitments, to a willing rebel with an atrocity to avenge and no ties to keep him there.
When did it all happen? 
When the Sand People knocked Luke out, Obi Wan kept him unconscious for 24 hours ... in a world with no clouds one day looks pretty much like the other. 
C3P0 was turned off for the duration ... R2-D2 was an accomplice and the Sand People were in on it too. 
But WHY?? 
Obi Wan knew that Luke was the key to getting to Vader, he was never going to leave the family farm and the stakes were too high ... also, Owen and Ben hated each others’ guts “that crazy old man” ... “that’s your uncle talking” etc.
What, you think Obi Wan was a nice old Santa Clause guy? He hacked off his best friend’s limbs and left him to burn alive. Almost everything he ever said to Luke was proven to be a lie “your father wanted you to have his lightsaber (he told me that just after I cut his legs off) when you were ready” ... “this babe needs your help and she is totally NOT your sister” ... “Vader murdered your father” ... etc. 
He knew about the space battle, the droid message, the escape pod, Jawas and he orchestrated R2 disappearing into the Tusken Wastes. 
It was always about Vader and Obi Wan’s guilt over setting him loose on the universe. 
Considering the stakes, can you doubt that he would sacrifice a cranky old farmer and his wife??"

903,1599968268.0,StarWarsTheories,"Moff Gideon is related by blood to Tarre Vizsla. - My Theory and prediction going into season 2 of Mandalorian is that Moff Gideon is related to the mandolorian jedi who created the dark saber.

Tarre Vizsla showcased in Season 3 of Star Wars Rebels May come back into play for Season 2 of the Mandalorian. As Esposito has claimed that we will learn more about the dark saber and its history. With the connection with the Mandalorian Jedi. This may explain the recent rumours of Moff Gideon being force sensative. And explain why he apparently knows a lot about the Jedi, cause his ancestor was one. 

Being Related to the man who created the Dark saber May further explain his claim to the darksaber as a birth right something that belongs to him. 

Plus this they further may explain why he might want baby yoda. “Extract the necessary material” we bringing back  Midi-chlorians into the mix. And does moff Gideon want to increase his Midi-chlorian count further increasing his force sensitivity to the point where he is like tarre Vizsla.

904,1599930263.0,StarWarsTheories,"[Mandalorian Speculation] Moff Gideon wants the Child not because of its strength in the force but because of the Child’s genetic material may reveal the secret to unnaturally long life. - Through-out the Star Wars films and TV series we’ve only been introduced to three of Yoda’s species: Yoda, Yaddle and the Child. All of them are naturally gifted in the force, but so what? Lots of people during this time period have incredible force potential (Leai, Luke Ahsoka, Ben?) What else makes this species so special? Why is the Client and Moff Gideon so desperate to retrieve the Child?

I think I know why: **It’s their incredibly long lifespace. This is what makes the species special and potentially dangerous.**

The Client needs the Child’s DNA so they can learn how the species lives so long and copy its genetics. He could be under direct orders from Gideon to capture the Child for the express purpose of extending/reviving Sidious.

Though, I suspect Gideon will have different plans in the end. Due to his reckless attack on the fellow Imperials, his goal could be to destroy the child and prevent Sidious from returning or to use the genetic material for himself. I believe his overarching plan is to lead his own group of Imperial remnants and create his own galactic empire.

I doubt we’ll see Palpantine, Snoke or the Sith Eternal in the series, just a reference to them to set the context of a power struggle between the remaining vestiges of the empire. The Mandalorian series is doing great on its own, it doesn’t need to fully tie into the Skywalker Saga, just a few brief references here and there to set the context within the galaxy.

What do you think? I know the evidence is thin, but I really think a plot like this could work."

Who knows if Rey alone would win a fight against 8 to 10 elite guards, but I don’t want to get into the rabbit hole of technicalities or likelihoods of that fight right now. 

I think it was maybe because the guards thought that Snoke was their only leader and that no other person could hold a candle to him. Either that or they were clones created by Palpatine to swear allegiance to only Snoke.

Someone, rightfully, told me him essentially retconning the saga that gave him purpose is a bad idea. Thinking back on this now, I agree. It ruins the beauty of turmoil of what makes it Star Wars. I have a better idea. So Ben’s last words to Rey were “I’ll always be with you,” to which she replies “No one’s ever really gone.” He doesn’t live on in Rey. And he isn’t a force ghost, showing why he isn’t with Luke and Leia. His body passes in time. Not into the future. Any force being out of balance after TROS would be like beating a dead horse. But going back over a millennium, to the Old Republic would be a perfect way to bring a well known character in an unknown world. It shows more of the protagonist side of his character, and allows for characters like Revan, Malek, Satele Shan, Bastille Shan, and Darth Nihilis to come into Canon. How crazy would it be if Revan were to become Ben’s new master, before becoming a Sith?! Obviously, it’d have to be animated, since currently Adam Driver is wanting to move on from Star Wars.

914,1598722571.0,StarWarsTheories,"Palpatine cheated the Prophecy - 
Okay so as we all know Anakin Skywalker is the Chosen One to ultimately bring balance to the Force. However, as we all know Palpatine survived which made some people theorise that Rey was the Chosen One or that the Prophecy was wrong however I have a different theory:

I believe Palpatine was meant to die on the second Death Star. I believe that’s what the Prophecy alluded to and what was meant to happen to bring peace to the Galaxy. But I think Palpatine had planned for this. I think he knew eventually that he would die or that the Force would try to strike back after his and his masters’ meddling with it. 

As we all know, Palpatine has tried to manipulate the Force before for his own benefits and due to it trying to fight against him it created Anakin Skywalker. So I believe he once again tried to manipulate the Force to change his destiny if the time ever came for him to die. With a combination of the Force and Science to save himself and transfer his essence to another body he had prepared. 

In the original script Kylo Ren said Palpatine was a clone to which Palpatine replied: “More than a clone, less than a man.” So it would seem the new body he had prepared for himself was incompatible and the body was slowly degrading.

So I believe Palpatine found a loophole to save himself and cheated destiny however this led to him not being truly in sync with the Force and this meant he could manipulate it to his own measures without having to worry about any prophecies. 

I also like to think that all the Jedi themselves helped to get rid of Palpatine, giving their power to Rey to finally destroy him without the need of destiny.

921,1598407379.0,StarWarsTheories,"Skywalker Force Ghosts -  To start this off if anyone else has posted this before sorry, I have had this theory since TLJ and watching TROS only strengthened this theory.

So I believe that all Skywalkers do not require the training that Yoda and Obi-Wan needed to do to become force ghosts thanks to Anakin's legacy.

Starting off with Anakin. We know he didn't get training as a Jedi as only Yoda had done it at this point. As a Sith, Vader wouldn't have been able to complete the training (I think). But since he is the chosen one he is given a free pass to becoming a force ghost.

For all we know Luke could've done the training after Yoda told him about that wacky stuff he went through during the Clone Wars. However as of now we just don't know if he did the training or not. If he didn't then I believe being the son of the chosen one gave him a free pass (this repeats for the next two).

At the end of TROS we see force ghost Leia alongside Luke. Now we know that she started her Jedi training but training to be a force ghost seems like it's only for Jedi Masters or those with enough experience. So being a Skywalker, she became a force ghost automatically.

Now with Ben Solo we don't actually know if he became a force ghost but every person we have seen disappear in the films has become a force ghost. So if he is a force ghost then same as Leia, he was only a padawan when he became Kylo and like Vader he wouldn't have been able to do the training (again I think). So once again being a Skywalker basically just gives him that free pass. But if he didn't become a force ghost then I think the Solo in him basically muddied his bloodline (?) And isn't a pure Skywalker.

Again I haven't seen this anywhere before just wanted to share my thoughts.

Tl;dr: All Skywalkers can be force ghosts because Anakin was the chosen one."
922,1598293523.0,StarWarsTheories,"S O M E H O W P A L P A T I N E R E T U R N E D (This is 100% not canon btw, this was just a thought I had while taking a shit. Inb4 Disney appropriates this with a tweet and attempts to retcon the dumpster fire that is the Sequel Trilogy) - So now that that train wreck of a title is out of the way, let's get down to business.  Our story begins long ago (before the Prequel Trilogy even) to a time when Darth Plagueis was a mere apprentice to the Dark Lord of the Sith.  This could be anyone else if you want it to be, but the kernel is that the apprentice has betrayed his master but failed to kill him.  Fearing his master's retribution, the young apprentice flees to Korriban to seek out the teachings of Ancient Sith and to use their forgotten power to help him defeat his former master.

In the darkest depths of a tomb among the thousands of ruins scattered across Korriban's destroyed surface, the apprentice discovers a powerful Sith Spirit (again, this could be anyone you want it to be) and strikes a bargain with it in order to obtain ""UNLIMITED... POWER!""  However, the apprentice gravely underestimates the strength of the Spirit and becomes possessed.  His will is bent and broken to that of this ancient evil.

This Spirit embodies the creed and philosophy of the Sith.  Its primary drive is to seek out powerful Force users and seduce them to the Dark Side of its teachings.  It grooms these apprentices to the point where they become even more powerful that its current host.  When the apprentice inevitably betrays the master, the Spirit uses the bond between teacher and student to take complete possession of the apprentice, leaving the late host as an empty husk in the dirt.

Whether he was the first or later down the line, eventually Darth Plagueis becomes possessed by this Sith Spirit.  He is by far one of the most potent Sith in history, but Darth Sidious erroneous attributes this power to Plagueis himself and not the Spirit, of which he is unaware.  When Sidious betrays and murders Plagueis in his sleep, the Spirit takes possession of and consumes him.  This lends his condescending ""Tragedy of Darth Plagueis the Wise"" a touch of dramatic irony in Revenge of the Sith.

Palpatine's, or rather the Spirit's, objective for episodes 1-6 is to groom Darth Vader (the supposed most-powerful Force user in history) to the point where he can become the new host.  Everything goes according to plan until the very end of episode 6, where Vader sacrifices himself to save his son Luke (who the Spirit had briefly considered for possession, but later decided was not possible for reasons that are about to be explained).  In order for the possession to work, it is imperative that the subject not only be reasonably close to the current host, but to also have given themselves entirely to the Dark Side of the Force.  As Palpatine plunged to his death in the Second Death Star, the Spirit could not take possession of either Luke or Vader -- and was instead forced to leech itself onto a random Imperial Officer evacuating the doomed Space Station.

This was a tremendous setback because, while the Dark Side had completely consumed this new host, this officer had almost no connection to the Force itself.  The Spirit was forced to go into hiding on Exegol, where it spent decades on experiments to try and grow Force-Sensitive clones (like Snoke) and to try and kindle a connection to the Force in its current, fragile host.  Then, everything changed when it discovered that Ben Skywalker was strong with the Force.  The objective became to seduce this young, impressionable boy to the Dark Side so that the Spirit might finally have a worthy host once again.

Suddenly, everything changed once again when the Spirit discovered that Palpatine had a grand-daughter who was even more powerful than Vader.  The plan shifted once again to try and seduce this young girl from Jakku to the Dark Side so that the Spirit could have some of that MaRey Sue juice and become the most powerful being in the universe.

The the final battle on Exegol, ""Palpatine's"" cringey line ""I am ALL the Sith"" is no longer a desperate imitation of Endgame, but rather a terrifying revelation about this evil Spirit's history of possessions.  This still doesn't fix Rey's cringey ""And I am Iron Man"" response, but oh well.  The reason why ""Palpatine"" dies ""for realz this time guys I promise"" is because there were no new valid hosts close enough for the Spirit to take possession when he died, since they were all in battle overhead.  Except *maybe* Kylo Ren.  Rey dies, so she wouldn't have been a valid target even if she had fallen to the Dark Side.  Then, as a final moment of defiance, Kylo Ren sacrifices himself to resurrect Rey -- destroying the Spirit with his death if it had managed to take possession.

I'm sure some hardcore lore lawyers could pick apart this ""theory"" in minutes.  I still think it's better than what is canon... then again, just about anything is better than literally nothing at all."

This all makes sense and fits nicely. However Anakin messes with this greatly.  See we watch luke have a final conversation with his father telling him to leave him nothing can prevent his death now. Luke says he won't leave him and then the now redeemed anakin appears to die. Notably he does not vanish like the Yoda or Obi-Won. 

Wookiepedia explains that Luke burned Vader's empty armor but that seems more like reaching to fix a plot hole. (I will admit that is what I'm doing but I figured mine makes more sense)

Now it's possible that Vader learned how to force ghost from Palpatine. However I feel this is unlikely as Vader seemed confused by Obi-won's conversion. Frankly Palpatine never seemed to trust Vader with much when you consider that he didn't act in the offical chain of command but outside of it.  A way to become truly immortal seems like something he would hold over Vader to keep him in line. Because I feel Vader would simply have converted himself some time ago. Vader hated his  existence as Darth Vader, by that I mean being trapped in the suit unable to touch and interact with the world.

Anyways knowing that it seems unlikely that Vader knew how to convert himself fully and not does it appear in the movie that he does so. How is it that Anakin becomes a fully imbodied force ghost at the end of 6 and why do we never see him again. See Yoda is still around 20 years from now and Luke still talks with him. Why doesn't he communicate with Kylo Ren and tell him to knock that shit off. Supposedly Anakin's has redeemed himself why wouldn't he simply have a chat with the kid to not do stupid shit in his name.

This is because Anakin didn't become a force ghost at least not by himself. Yoda taught Obi-Won how to become one with the force soon after he hide the children supposedly. This gave Obi-Won years to think about this ablility. See Obi-Won refused to admit that Anakin joined the dark side but instead that metaphorically Darth Vader killed Anakin, so in his mind Anakin died almost 20 year before. Almost 20 years to think about how to bring his brother back, plus 4 years as a cosmic force entity to make a plan.

At the end of episode 6 Luke see Anakin, Yoda, and Obi-Won. But after the release of 1,2, and 3 the original actor playing Anakin is replaced with younger version we know from the 1,2, and 3. However Obi-Won and yoda are still their old selves. I get replacing Anakin with an actor that new audiences watching would be familiar with, but why only Anakin?( I know this is because we're just being respectful of the original cast and the face of Anakin originally had no ties that people cared about.)


Option 1

I think Obi-Won made a fake force ghost to make Luke feel like he saved his father even though his father died. 


Option 2
There is a different idea I have to go with this. What if Obi-Won basically dragged Anakin into the cosmic side of the force. That way he could spend time with his brother especially if you consider that he might have left all the bits he didn't like behind, such as everything that was Darth Vader. Leaving to be burned up all the hate and lost that Anakin had, all the things that made him go mad. All those memories years of his life even. Anakin would have been a shell but maybe Obi-Won would get his brother back. The man he spent years raising and fighting a war with. Not the man who betrayed him and everything they fought for.

Then with Obi-Won creating a force ghost for himself he also created one for the shell of Anakin that he dragged back. See they don't even join in with the other people but stay to the side, maybe they do that because the Anakin ghost wouldn't stand up to close scrutiny.

Option 3
I mean it is possible for a third simple explanation Yoda and Obi-Won worked together to create a force ghost of the Anakin that they knew so that the redeemed Anakin that died in Luke's arms could wave goodbye. This would allow for Anakin to do a partial conversion like Qui-Gon, but still allow for a Anakin to force ghost and would explain why only Anakin is young as Yoda and Obi-Won only knew him when he was young.

As Qui-Gon had no other force ghost buddies to help him and by the time he did there wasn't really anyone left alive that he would have had a strong relationship too. He had no reason that would have warranted making a force ghost. 



Regardless all three of these explanations come down to one thing Anakin did not become one with the force like Yoda and Obi-Won. However it's possible he did so similar to Qui-gon. 


I highly recommend watch film theorie's episode about what force ghosts can do.

Tldr the redeemed Anakin Skywalker did not convert himself to cosmic side of the force and Obi-Won faked his final force ghost."

Let’s say Fives succeeds, Palpatine is arrested/executed, and the galaxy finds this out all at once; the Clone Wars were a sham.  
  
What do you think the galaxy’s reaction to this would be? Dooku’s involvement in the plot would surely be revealed and the Seperatists who weren’t aware would probably turn on him. I’d say the Republic would too but they’d be dealing with their own issues, I’d imagine that the galaxy would turn against them quite quickly realizing the Republic let all of this happen right before their eyes and were too naive to stop it. Somehow, in a twisted sense, it’s like Palpatine would succeed anyways.  
  
There’s also the issue of the entire clone army suddenly realizing how awful their true purpose actually was. I can’t imagine this would go over well, I think you’d see a lot of the more individualistic ones (Fives, Jesse, etc.) try and get the fuck away from this mess that really wasn’t their fault at all. Then on the flip side of that you’d have clones like the Coruscant Guard who essentially are what Fives thinks clones shouldn’t be (unthinking, exist purely to follow orders) and they’d likely still be fiercely loyal to the Republic which would probably cause them to clash heads with Fives. Finally you’d have clones stuck in the middle, like Rex, who I can’t imagine would ever leave the Republic but also obviously would be left super jaded by all of these realizations coming out at once."

Note that I only talk about movies (I haven't read books, comics, only watched The Mandalorian and some of The Clone Wars).  


There was the Force. It had a light side and a dark side. The adepts of the light side passed the Force through themselves and listened to the will of force. Dark side adepts wanted to subdue it for the sake of strength and power. And the Force was kept in balance. And when the dark ones began to muddy the waters, the Force created a dyad that restored balance.

Once the adepts of the dark side (Sith) were able to deceive the Force, and put it to sleep. And no more dyads were born to restore balance, there was only an artificial dyad - the Rule of Two, the rule of the Sith (""Always two, there are. No more. No less. A Master and an apprentice"" – Yoda, Episode 1). But this was not enough for the Sith, having power they most wanted to preserve it, and conducted dark experiments to achieve this goal - to gain immortality (""The dark side of the Force is a pathway to many abilities some consider to be unnatural"" – Palpatine, Episodes 3 and 9).

Through experimentation, one of the Sith, Darth Plagueis, was finally able to succeed and artificially created life – Anakin (“Darth Plagueis was a Dark Lord of the Sith, so powerful and so wise he could use the Force to influence the midichlorians to create life ... ""- Palpatine, Episode 3,"" There was no father. I carried him, I gave birth, I raised him. I can't explain what happened. "" – Shmi Skywalker, Episode 1). And it was the greatest irony - a product of the dark forces, created with all the lust for power and gaining immortality, ultimately fulfilled the prophecy (Episode 6 – ""Return of the Jedi""), ended the Rule of Two and restored balance, even though it had to shake the entire galaxy to do so. Not that, of course, the Jedi expected (""A prophecy that misread could have been."" – Yoda, Episode 3).

The Force awakened (Episode 7 – ""The Force Awakens"") and when Sidious's dark forces hit the galaxy again (The First Order), the Force gave birth to a new dyad (""The life force of your bond, a dyad in the force. A power over life itself. Unseen for generations ... "" – Palpatine, Episode 9). And the dyad fulfilled its purpose and restored the balance once again (""Bring back the balance, Rey, as I did."" – Anakin, Episode 9).

An interesting comparison: the Force is a living organism, Sith (not adherents of the dark side in general) are a disease, Anakin is a medicine, Dyad is immunity)."

George kept Yoda’s origin intentionally vague and the Mandalorian Series may finally explore it. This is an exciting premise for those of us who’ve been itching to find out where this extremely powerful, multiple supercentenarian, and utterly unique species is from.

In my mind, it plays out sorta like Superman’s origin. Babies are sent out from the host planet in every direction to bring peace and prosperity to the worlds they land in. These gifted creatures can survive extremely long space flight and when they arrive their very nature guides them to help others. 

The known SW galaxy has now encountered three of these beings. Mando may learn the origin of this creature, or he could simply be told that the species has no origin in this galaxy.

Disney has said somewhere they wont necessarily tie themselves to a new trilogy but I would imagine we will get a high stakes trilogy esque announcement sometime in the next 6 months.

I personally think they are done with the time period between episodes 1-9 from a Saga perspective.  This time frame can be fleshed out with animated, live action tv shows, stand alone movies, books comics etc.

When it comes to the Saga movies they will likely ""reboot"" by moving significantly into the past (my vote) or future. This way they wont be held to lofty expectations from fans about mishandling beloved characters. 

I also do not believe it will be ""KOTOR"" time frame (making KOTOR cannon) as that presents a lot of challenges like do you bring the Revan/Malak story to the big screen? Do you change the story but keep the characters, do you reboot it all?

My best guess is we end up in the past but not KOTOR past... Gives a fully realized jedi order and sith (no rule of 2).

So during the Clone Wars season 6 when Yoda has the dark side vision and is inside the temple we see Mace Windu (dead), Petro (dead) and Ahsoka (nearly dead). It turns out in ROTS that Anakin is responsible for both Mace and Petro's deaths (either directly or indirectly) whilst Ahsoka is not quite dead, this could be because Anakin nearly killed her as Vader in Rebels but Ezra saved her. Showing why she isn't dead in Yoda's vision. This foreshadows Anakin's turn and the consequences it has. 

Following this vision he is invited into another world by Katooni. This always seemed strange as she was just another Youngling and of no real importance to Yoda. Surely if it meant nothing, having Obi Wan, Qui Gon or even Dooku tempt him into this other world would make more sense.

Or is it a different reason why she did it? she isn't dead in the temple which, if the first part of the theory is to be believed, means Anakin never killed her (or contributed to her death) she is a vision sent from the dark side and she witnessed Barriss's fight with Anakin at the end of Season 5.

Could this mean she agreed with Barriss's ideas and beliefs and potentially turned to the dark side as a young Inquisitor following the fall of the Jedi? Or maybe prior like the Grand Inquisitor (I think he fell before anyway🤷‍♂️)

We know that Obi-Wan is on Tatooine to watch over the young son of Anakin, but why? Vader doesn’t know he exists and will most likely never find him on his own. Vader even comes face-to-face with his daughter and doesn’t figure it out. So, why the hell is Obi-Wan stationed on Tatooine? Here’s my take:

**He’s there to monitor and make sure that Luke doesn’t become the next Vader**. 

After the fall of the Republic, Obi-Wan is given the arduous task of the remaining Jedi. He has to hide on an inhabited planet and keep a close eye on the developing Skywalker. He loved his brother Anakin, but he’s also seen the horrors that he committed. Will his son go down the same path, or is there a brighter future for Luke? This is the hard reality Obi-Wan must live with and monitor everyday. 

Kenobi will be under strict direction from Yoda to not train the boy. Yoda senses great anger in him, the same anger that he sensed in Anakin. Together they make the difficult decision not to mettle in his fate. If the force wills him to be involved in the galactic conflict, then so be it, but the boy is too great a risk to rely on. (\*This stane will change after a chance encounter with two droids)

Leia’s fate is different. Bail Organa is confident with his daughter and plans to make her a leader within the rebellion. Yoda and Obi-Wan approve because they sense no darkness in her. She develops quickly as a young competent leader on Alderaan and in the growing rebellion.

Throughout the show I believe we’ll see Bail, Obi-Wan and Yoda conversing and planting the seeds of the rebellion. They’ll keep their distance, but they won’t be sitting idle in exile. There’s too much at stake to withdraw entirely from the galaxy at large.

What do you think?

Here it goes: At the end of Empire, Lando and Chewie are out searching for Han. I guess that took them an entire year. They find Jabba's palace and Lando infiltrates it disguised as a guard. He also sends Chewie back to the Alliance on the Falcon so they can form a rescue plan, but the alliance just found out about the second Death Star, and doesn't want to put any resources into rescuing Han. Leia, however, is in love with Han and sneaks away with Chewie to rescue him. Luke hears about this and heads to Tatooine with the droids. Leia and Chewie run into a bounty hunter who Leia uses for her disguise. I'm assuming this is how Jabba knew Leia was lying because she was disguised as Boushh, a named character. I guess Jabba knew who Boushh was, and saw through it. During this Luke contacted Lando and formed the plan to give Jabba the droids and get himself sent to the pit of carcoon, where R2 gives him his lightsaber. Lando informs Chewie of this before Han is put in the cell with him. From there events of the movie are depicting Luke rescuing Leia from the sail barge, so they can all leave.


Basically everyone except Leia (and C3PO) knew the plan because Leia was acting recklessly, and Luke had to form his plan around her mistakes.


On the other hand, there's a theory I like better than mine,  that I saw on YouTube. It says that the whole thing was a well thought out plan with backup plans and backups for the backups. It turns the whole thing into what is basically a heist, which I really like.

What kind of hijinks Hunter, Wrecker, Crosshair, Tech and Echo get into? Let’s explore!

First a few burning questions about Clone Force 99:

**1. Did the Bad Batch remove their inhibitor chips?** If so, when and how? I feel Tech will be the answer to all of this. Maybe he figures it out as order 66 is happening, or found the chip years ago and removed it not knowing it’s true purpose.

**2. In the press release it revealed that they will be mercenaries, but who will they be working for?** Who do they align with after the fall of the Republic? I think we’ll see them taking all kinds of jobs from either the Alliance, Empire or the syndicates.  Throughout these jobs they will slowly start to eek out a living and find a purpose for their lives. 

**3. Do they age the same as other clones?** The BB are unique, maybe in more ways than we think. They could age slower or faster than the other clones. This could open up possibilities of their stories exploring further time periods beyond the aftermath of the clone wars.

**Now it’s time to speculate!** Based on the info provided by Lucasfilm and my own half-assed knowledge of the Star Wars universe, this is what I predict for the shows plot:

The Bad Batch will start with a flashback of the cloning process on Kamino. The BB clones will nearly be discarded before Kaminoan notices their unique abilities. They will be separated from the core clones and trained and experimented on to eventually become the venerable Clone Force 99. 

Flash-forward to the present time. Order 66 is executed, and Hunter senses the ensuing chaos. The Batch doesn’t turn on the Jedi because Tech had already removed their inhibitor chips. Echo still has his chip, so the Batch use him to figure out more about the Palpabtine’s plans before removing his chip as well.

The boys will try to help their brethren, but ultimately the task will be too much for them to handle and they retreat to the unknown regions.

This is where the brunt of the show will start. Force 99 will hop around throughout the fringes of the galaxy taking any mercenary work to stay afloat. Tech eventually has a breakthrough and figures out how to easily deactivate chips remotely. 

The crew now aims to start liberating as many of their brainwashed brothers as possible.

The latter half of the show will focus on the Batch liberating clones and setting up a free clone colony hidden in the unknown regions of the galaxy.

The Bad Batch will go to any lengths to protect their fellow clones, even if it means close encounters with the empire, the inquisitors or anyone else that may harm the clones.

There you go, that’s my early prediction for the show. Where do you think the show will go? What characters do you think will make an appearance? Ahsoka? Maul?

955,1594591551.0,StarWarsTheories,"Lee-Char’s name is a play on one of two figures from English Royal history - The first one being Charles II (also known as the Cavalier King) who retook the throne from Oliver Cromwell after Cromwell killed his father, Charles I. Cromwell was a brutal but excellent general, much like Riff Tamsin.

The second one is Charles Edward Stuart, better known as Bonnie Prince Charlie. Charles Stuart was the son of the last Catholic king of England, James II, who was deposed and fled to Rome. Charles Stuart returned to England and repeatedly tried to claim the throne, with Ireland and Scotland supporting him, but ultimately was defeated and faded into song and history. 
This is like how Lee Char attempts to rebel against the Empire but is ultimately defeated and his legacy is mostly the mon Cala fleet."

This would explain why Padme went from being okay and giving birth to being on her deathbed at the exact same time that Anakin went from being barely alive and on the verge of death (his heart stops beating in the scene where Vader is born for like 12 seconds) to literally being reborn as Darth Vader (his heart starts beating again after the mask is sealed)."

961,1594279274.0,StarWarsTheories,"There is an ending in the 2005 Battlefront 2 where the CIS defeat the Republic and Count Dooku kills Anakin on Mustafar, how would the original trilogy be different if that happened? - You can watch it here:  [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=64-HIqH1ivo](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=64-HIqH1ivo)

Unfortunately nothing about this hypothetical timeline has ever been explored, so I'm going to list some possible scenarios that could result from this outcome (yes I'm making a big hypothetical story out of a obscure 30 second video):

* There is no scene of any Jedi besides Anakin dying, it's possible that in this timeline that Yoda and Mace Windu are still alive, Obi Wan is likely to be alive too, the reason he isn't seen in the Mustafar scene alongside Anakin is probably because he had to split up to fight General Grevious (who is shown to be alive and well in this ending).
* Obi Wan wouldn't be lying to Luke in this universe's version of ANH about his father dying a hero at the hands of a former Jedi, Anakin's force ghost would probably play an important part in training Luke.
* Palpatine would probably sign a surrender treaty with the CIS, and fake his good personas death under a mocked televised execution before changing to his Emperor persona, the CIS would likely call themselves the Galactic Empire, since they aren't a Confederation of ""Independent"" Systems since nobody would be Independent from anything anymore.
* The Rebel Alliance would be most likely better supplied and have more manpower, considering that they would inherit more resources from the Old Republic and have a better image in the eyes of the average citizen as a government in exile from a more civilised age so the CIS version of the Galactic Empire would have a harder time convincing people to see them as a terrorist organisation, this would lead to more recruits, in addition to this there would be lots of Clones in their ranks and lots of Republic battleships and Starfighters to compliment the spacecraft they had in the original timeline,possibly even replacing them entirely, they might go by an entirely different name, like the Republic remnants or Loyalist Alliance.
* Clones would remain loyal to the Rebellion for a few reasons, first of all in the CIS story the Kamino facility gets overrun, so Palpatine probably sees Clones as having outlived their usefulness in his scheme and pulled the plug on them completely, in addition to that, the Rebellion would appoint a new provisional Chancellor (which could be Mon Mothma, Bail Organa, or Padme if she's still alive) that the Clones would recognise as their legal legitimate leader, which would make Palaptine pulling an order 66 toothless.
* The beginning of A New Hope would be more or less the same, except that Battle Droids would board the Tantive IV instead of Stormtroopers, the Rebel Troops fighting in the ships hallway might even get mowed down by Droidekas, Leia would get interrogated by Count Dooku or General Grevious instead of Vader.
* Luke's introduction would be mostly the same, except that the Jawas and adoptive parents would've been killed by Super Battle Droids instead of Stormtroopers, Obi Wan would say ""see these blast points are too accurate for sand people, only Super Battle Droids are so percise"", when Luke and Obi Wan are stopped by a Imperial patrol in Mos Eisley, it would probably be a bunch of ""roger roger"" type droids.
* Since the CIS were shown in Attack of the Clones to have access to the Death Star Plans, Alderaan might still be destroyed, Tarkin would've likely defected to the CIS after the Republics defeat, though another planet might be destroyed, in the 501st story in Battlefront 2 it depicts the Naboo government as being part of the Rebel alliance, if Padme is still alive and serving as Chancellor of the Republic government in exile, it would make it a perfect target.
* When on the Death Star, Luke and Han would have to find another way to get into Leia's cell since theres no way they could pass as droids due to having no human like anatomy to the extant that Luke and Han could fake.
* When Obi Wan encounters Count Dooku or General Grevious, they could say something to the effect of ""I'm am the master of the force/lightsaber combat"", Obi Wan would reply by saying ""Only a master of evil Count/General"" the same way he said ""Only a master of evil Darth"" to Vader.
* Once the main characters reach the Rebel base (which might or might not be Yavin IV), it would be a similar scene, though there would be notable differences, Luke and the other pilots might be given a Clone Pilot flightsuit  from ROTS instead of an orange flightsuit, they could meet surviving Jedi at the base, the meeting room with General Dodonna (who would remain a Republic Admiral) would probably be the size of a college or university lecture hall, during Death Star battle Han would knock out Count Dookus weird looking sail ship instead of Vader's bomber.

On the top of my head, that's about all I can think of, I would like to hear your thoughts on this unexplored timeline, is your headcanon of this scenario the mostly same or entirely different from mine? what would be the plot twist of Empire Strikes Back? how would Jango Fett in the words of the in game Clones, ""growing a new head"" change the story?   how would the droids react to being attacked by Ewoks? and what would be the conclusion of Return of the Jedi in this timeline?"
962,1594208620.0,StarWarsTheories,"How would the Republic respond of the universe was about to meet it's end (big crunch, heat death etc)? - On an ordinary day in the Star Wars universe, a Republic Admiral receives a transmission that an entire system of planets has gone dark, he orders a a fleet to go to that sector to find out what happened but never returned, the Republic assumes at first that it's the result of some kind of superweapon, but after various witnesses including current and former enemies are trialled it is concluded that there is no evidence that such a weapon exists, later they receive reports that planets that are at war with the Republic have also perished, Republic scientists soon discovered that the universe is about to end within 5 years, first through a giant heatwave followed by a massive crunch that would end all life (or something to that effect).

How would the Republic respond out of these options:

1. Cover it up from the public so everyone can die at peace.
2. Have the Chancellor along with the Jedi tell everyone at a televised senate meeting what is about to happen, and encourage people to make up for their wrongdoings so they may have a future in the afterlife (after all, doesn't hell exist in Star Wars according to ESB?).
3. Order the Jedi to find a supernatural solution, such as using the world between worlds to resettle everyone in the past, or use a similar force gateway to escape to another dimension.
4. Order scientists to make a hyperdrive that would allow everyone to escape to another dimension."

964,1594038889.0,StarWarsTheories,"Fulfilling The Prophecy is Not the Main Element of Anakins Arc. - After episode IX a lot of people said that the return of Palpatine ruined Anakins arc in episode I-VI. I disagree because my theory is that Anakins arc isn't to be the chosen one and bring balance to the force. The overarching theme of his story is slavery and servitude.

In TPM the reason Anakin wants to become a Jedi is to end slavery. He was born a slave and it is all he had ever known. Becoming a Jedi wasn't even his main goal, he wanted to be a pirate, a smuggler, a soldier. Anything that would get him off Tatooine and out of slavery.

In AOTC Anakin has spent 10 years being indoctrinated by the Jedi and has forgotten his aspirations of freedom, until he sees Padme again, and remembers why he left Tatooine and the promise he made to free slaves. 

In ROTS we finally see Anakin get the chance to be seen as an equal among his peers and no longer resigned to servitude, and then the Jedi refuse to give him the rank of Master. That is why he is so outraged. After turning to the Dark Side his is still intent on becoming Emperor and ending slavery in the galaxy, until he loses to Obi-Wan and Padme dies. After this he has no more fight left in him. He is stuck being a slave to Palpatine, the Dark Side and his own suit forever. 

Then when Luke and Leia enter his life he sees their unwillingness to accept slavery. Luke is unwilling to become the Emperors new slave and Leia is fighting tooth and nail to end the Empires rule in the galaxy. At the end of ROTJ Anakin remembers why he left Tatooine as a boy, and he sees his chance to end his own enslavement. Whether Palpatine dies when thrown down the pit or not is irrelevant, by throwing him down there Anakin has become free for the first time in his life, and dies free from the slavery of Palpatine, the Dark Side and his suit.

Tl;dr: Anakins arc is about him being a slave his entire life up until the moment he betrays the emperor and finally becomes free."
965,1593923985.0,StarWarsTheories,"[Theory] “Solo: A Star Wars Story” is an Homage to George Lucas’s Life - **Theory**

After rewatching, I realized that *Solo: A Star War Story* is a personal homage to George Lucas’s life growing up racing modded cars in Modesto, failing to join the US Airforce, taking risks, and eventually defying and reinventing Hollywood.

**Intro**

Like many others, I struggled to find a reason why Lucasfilm would make a Han Solo movie? Han’s veiled backstory added so much intrigue to the scruffy nerf-herder.

Only after watching Solo for a third time did I start to notice the similarities between Han’s origin story and Lucas’s own. Honestly, watching the movie from this angle gives me more respect for the film and the vision that producers and directors may have had for it.

**Points**

I could be wrong, but here are the aspects I found in Solo that parallel George’s own life:

**1. Car Racing:** George is an avid car racing enthusiast and enjoyed souping-up and racing vehicles with his friends in Modesto. Solo features an extended getaway chase in Corellia where Han proves his mettle by escaping Moloch and imperial forces with his driving abilities.

Later in the movie Han yet-again proves his worth by setting a galactic speed/(distance?) record by completing the Kessel run in 12 parsecs. This scene felt every bit like a race scene straight out of a Fast and Furious movie.

**2. Aspiring Pilot.** As a youth George aspired to be a pilot and even applied to the US Airforce. He was ultimately turned down due to his numerous speeding tickets. Likewise, Han applies to be an imperial pilot but is ultimately relegated to infantry.

**3. Breaking into a Clique.** Han’s a scrappy dude, but he’s overly confident and has limitless ambition. Desiring freedom, Han broke through his humble upbringing on Corellia to join an upstart group of thieves. He found solace in this group that defied the oppressive system and he eventually gains trust and respect from his peers. George similarly broke into the film scene as a scrappy young director. He joined a clique known as the “Dirty Dozen” early on. As he grew as a film-maker, Lucas pushed back against the restrictive policies of Hollywood studios and eventually went on to form his own studio where he was unrestrained. 

**4. Ron Howard.** Ron is crucial piece to all of this. I believe that Ron steered this movie to be an homage to his friend. Howard was prominent child actor, but by George casting him in American Graffiti Ron was catapulted to blockbuster fame. Solo is thank-you from Ron to George; honouring his personal life and the legacy he left.

What do you think? Did you notice any more parallels between Solo and Lucas?"
966,1593837110.0,StarWarsTheories,"Force Ghost Theory - Just watched the film theorists video on why he thinks FORCE ghosts don't do anything to help out during the movies. His theory is ok but I don't think its the full picture.

FORCE ghosts are pure FORCE energy right? So obviously if they were seen by a sith the sith would be able to grab a hold of them using the FORCE and be manipulated by them. I mean, just imagine if Palpatine saw a FORCE ghost of Yoda. He is so crazy about immortality he would use his FORCE to trap Yoda's FORCE ghost and force him to tell him the secrets of the FORCE ghosts.

Then on top of that couldn't Palpatine also absorb the FORCE ghost's FORCE to replenish his life FORCE like he did with Rey and Ben's FORCE dyad? I mean, its pretty obvious to me and it would be obvious to the FORCE ghost themselves if not explicitly warned to them by the FORCE priests during the FORCE ghost training.

So yeah, the FORCE ghosts stay away from the sith because they are straight up FORCE energy that can be trapped and absorbed or whatever. And you know how Palpatine is, he would straight up use his FORCE to trap FORCE ghost Yoda in a tube or something and lol at him and torture him until Yoda tells him about the FORCE ghost technique then he would reverse engineer some crazy sith version.

prove me wrong

Just imagine Yoda eating baby yoda the way baby yoda ate that frog thing. Like, the adult yodas have a irresistible urge to eat their young. So maybe the adult yodas lay eggs somewhere and the baby yodas run away after hatching or they'll get eaten. Then they rely on being raised by other species which is why they have evolved to be small and cute. Also, maybe if they have siblings the baby yodas fight and eat each other too which also explains why theres so few of them.

968,1593821692.0,StarWarsTheories,"Alternate TLJ theory - So I promised it and here it is- the alternate TLJ theory. I thought my first theory was too influenced by material already in Legends. So for this one, I'm keeping some elements, but keeping it original. My movie is called Return of the Shadow and the plot is as follows:

At the start of my movie, we would see Jacen Solo on a mission on Umbara, having graduated from Luke's Jedi Temple, and training Ben Skywalker, Luke and Mara's son, as we see in Legacy of the Force. It would never be explicitly said but the time jump would be five or six years, making Ben 17 and Jacen and Jaina 25, giving them some experience. During Jacen and Ben's Umbara mission, they would be imprisoning a clan of Yuuzhan Vong that is on that planet. But instead of wounding them and taking them to Coruscant for questioning, Jacen would kill them all while Ben secretly watches from their ship, horrified. Jacen would look back at the dead Vong and his eyes would flash yellow. They would return to the temple and Ben would tell the New Jedi Council that they all killed themselves rather than returning for imprisonment. The next thing we see would be a very heated argument between Jacen and Jaina where Jacen tells her he is losing faith in the Jedi. This is where Jacen and Jaina would get word that Krayt had resurfaced. They would be sent to bring him in together. During this mission, Jacen tells Ben not to come with him and leaves him in Mara's care. Jacen and Jaina confront Krayt on the now-barren Vong planet, and after a long battle. Krayt would overpower Jacen and Jaina and leave them to die. Ben was not happy with the decision to leave him at the Temple, and he would notice Jacen's coordinates being transmitted. He tells Luke and Mara and they go to the Vong planet, once again leaving Ben. But Ben stows away on their ship and comes with them. Luke and Mara would then fight Darth Krayt, and just as Krayt throws his lightsaber at Luke to kill him, Ben leaps in front and is hit and killed. As Mara jumps onto Ben in a desperate attempt to keep him alive, Krayt also kills her. At this moment, as Luke is reeling, Jacen jumps up behind Krayt and decapitates him. Now, Luke, Jacen, and Jaina return to the ship. But as they get on, a voice talks to Jacen and tells him that the Jefi failed him, but he will not. A hooded figure appears and takes off his hood, revealing Darth Plaguies' scarred face. After looking at Luke and Jaina sadly, Jacen goes with Plaguies and fully becomes Darth Caedus. Now at the final scene of the film, Jaina returns to the order. After that, Luke tells her that he is going away from the order, and it becomes almost a Fate of the Jedi situation, but without Ben. Leia is granted the rank of Grand Master, and Jacen builds his red lightsaber.

This was a very long theory and I spent a long time working on it, so thanks for reading to the end and I'll make my TROS alternate timeline soon."

970,1593659433.0,StarWarsTheories,"Alternate TFA theory - So i thought there were a lot of missed opportunities in the sequels, and I'm going to do a series of theories about how I would have done them, starting today with TFA.

So the first thing I would have done is nullified the New Jedi Order, Legacy of the Force and Fate of the Jedi, but keep the characters and all other Legends material. So we would start off at Luke's Jedi Temple, much how Kevin.J.Anderson and Rebecca Moesta's Young Jedi Knights starts out, but with Jacen and Jaina about 19 or 20, about to graduate from Luke's temple and become Jedi Knights. I would have it set 20 years after ROTJ and the main threat would be the Yuuzhan Vong and I would do a version of Colin Trevorrow's Duel of the Fates idea, with Darth Plaguies having survived Palpatine's attempted killing at the end of Darth Plaguies. This would be set up in the first movie of the sequel trilogy, which I would have named The New Jedi Order. I would also integrate some material from Legacy, having Darth Krayt being the main threat in my version.  I would have Darth Plaguies pulling the strings from behind the scenes, but only as a mysterious hooded figure ordering Krayt around. Krayt would be the leader of the Yuuzhan Vong, and the movie would go along the lines of Heir to the Empire, with Leia and Han in the Senate on a rejuvenated Coroscant, and Luke training the new Jedi in the old temple on Ach-To. Jacen and Jaina would be travelling the galaxy with Luke and Leia, learning how to be a jedi. It would culminate witha battle between LUke and the hooded figure who we as the audience know is Plaguies, but Luke doesn't, and Jacen and Jaina fighting Krayt on another level of the Vong planet, trying to get Ben Skywalker, who has been held captive by Krayt, back.

971,1593622857.0,StarWarsTheories,"Ahoska is ""protected"" by the Force - In The Clone Wars, she is saved by the daughter after being killed by the son. First, the daughter is somewhat a part of the Force. She could be carrying out the will of the Force by saving Ahsoka. The daughter's action can be seen as ""the force saving Ahsoka"" from a certain point of view.

Secondly, in Rebels Ahsoka is saved by Ezra using the World between Worlds. The wolf named Dume (which is probably Kanan) tell Ezra to ""restore past, redeem future"". The line means two things, one destroy the Jedi temple and another is to save Ahsoka in the past. This could also be seen as ""the Force saving Ahsoka""

And when Ezra saw Morai in the World between Worlds. Morai is already at the portal which Ahsoka is in. Morai is somewhat a part of the Force also wants to save Ahsoka.The bird wants to save Ahsoka otherwise it wouldn't be there. 

I don't think it's a coincidence that Ahsoka being saved from death by the Force multiple times. She could have a bigger destiny than we thought. At the end of Rebels her Gandalf like appearance indicates she had because something much more. Also Gandalf in LOTR can't really be killed. I think there is some connections with Gandalf.

As we know Rey's father was the son of Palpatine,
But what if Rey's Mother was the daughter or grand-daughter Obi-Wan Kenobi? 
Rey has a British accent and as we know Obi-Wan also has one. Palpatine's son probably didn't have a British accent as he is related to Palpatine who didn't have a British accent. So this shows that Rey's mother gave Rey her accent. Now this doesn't prove anything but Obi-Wan did spend 19 years on Tatooine and this is plenty of time for Obi-Wan to have a child with somebody. Rey wouldn't be only strong in the force because of Palpatine being her grandfather, but Obi-Wan being her Great or Grandfather. This would point  more evidence towards why Rey so easily and quickly picked up using the force.

These are two of the most intense battles in the whole franchise. And the only two I remembered the most of. So I assumed they would all be that intense. But they arent, windu vs palpatine is much less intense than both of the mentioned duels. Obi wan is likely more than capable of defending against the emperor.It’s widely accepted that obi wan is weak in the force, but we don’t understand the force. He is powerful but his powers are more focused on defence. We call him weak in the force because he’s not strong in offensive use, and that’s all we understand. We see him block Vader’s push in the mustifar control room. And they both look equally strained. This moves on to my second point, he is half the balance. He is THE light side. He is the literal personification of the light. Everything about him is the light side. even down to his lightsaber form. in fact he was literally resistant to the dark side, he went through much more pain than Vader ever did.

977,1593155839.0,StarWarsTheories,"Thrawn, The Mandalorian, the Sequels, and Filoniverse- how they connect and overlap. - I have a theory that I believe to be backed by official news regarding Moff Gideon, his remnant, and their place in the Filoniverse. 

In Episode IX, Kylo Ren journeyed to Mustafar to acquire the Sith Wayfinder in order to track down Palpatine. In a deleted scene that was in the novelization, he confronted the Eye of Webbish Bog, essentially the guardian of the wayfinder. The creature was actually created but not used in the final film, however it’s been said that they are hoping to use it in The Mandalorian (1). What does this mean?

I think that Moff Gideon and his remnant are operating from one of two locations: Exegol or Mustafar. I highly doubt it’s Exegol considering that he would have to have been in possession of the wayfinder in order to track it, or at least have been part of those deemed loyal by Palpatine. Mustafar makes sense- Vader’s castle is there and Moff Gideon does have many traces of Vader’s character, especially since “he is trying to restore order to a lawless galaxy” (2). He could be trying to have a legitimate authority by commanding from there and he might be trying to exploit the Child by trying to implant himself with force powers. It might not be that impossible considering that Palpatine inhabited a clone body, but that’s a whole different case. 

How else does this tie in with the Filoniverse? Let’s look at the World between Worlds. In Rebels, Season 4, episode 13( I think) Ezra would go into a place between time and space. He saved Ahsoka’s life and could see past, present, and future timelines. That’s also allegedly what it’s like being a Force ghost- you see everything happening at once. It’s possible (I think unlikely) that the Child might actually be Baby Yoda who was brought into 9 ABY through the world between worlds (WBW) by mistake (Rebels sequel hasn’t been released at this time so the whereabouts of Ahsoka, Ezra, et. al are unknown). This also opens the possibility that Palpatine was able to exploit the WBW and ensure his survival/survival of the Empire, or perhaps Moff Gideon wants to gain access to it in order to change the past. 

Given that Mandalorians are believed to be extinct at this time but Sabine Wren is known to be alive after Endor, this means that she probably hasn’t been seen/in the limelight of the Rebellion/Republic for some time. The same can be said for Bo Katan (rumored to be alive and cast this fall for Mando S2) [3]. What about Boba Fett? He probably isn’t viewed in a good way by the Mandalorians given that he works for the Empire from time to time and has a reputation that doesn’t necessarily benefit their culture. It’s possible that he’ll be an enemy for Mando in the future, or that he’s employed by Moff Gideon for some unknown task. 

And last but not least, Thrawn (my favorite character in Empire at War). Where has he been? No doubt, he and Ezra had to work together to survive for a good 4 years. It’s possible that they weren’t in unknown space for that long and that he was picked up by the Empire. He might’ve gone to face off the Gryssk invasion (I’ll come back to this) or he stayed within the  ranks and fought valiantly, or my personal theory, he’s the big bad of the Mandalorian. I think that he’s Moff Gideon’s boss and is the figurehead leading the Imperial Remnant within the galaxy. It’s obvious that Moff Gideon has superiors, or at least equals, given that Dr. Pershing and the Client argue over keeping the Child alive or dead, and different tracking FOBS required the child alive or dead. What is Thrawn leading the imperials and trying to gear up force sensitive abilities for? The coming Gryssk invasion. Don’t believe me? In the Thrawn novels which take place during Rebels and before A New Hope, the Gryssk are shown to be a threat from the unknown regions that have been studying the Empire and Old Republic for years, and are planning an invasion of the galaxy. Thrawn’s Chiss people have fought the Gryssk in years past. I think the invasion of the galaxy hasn’t happened yet, but it will in coming shows and media. Thrawn knows that he can’t face the New Republic with his current fleet, and maybe Thrawn’s fleet is where all the missing star destroyers went (4). Anyway, this is all just speculation given what we already know. Thank you for coming to my TEDTalk!

978,1593137038.0,StarWarsTheories,"Ok, so other than the obvious fact that Disney didn’t plan that far ahead and therefore wasn’t ready to include Ahsoka and “Baby Yoda” (God! I’m so tired of calling him that) in the sequel trilogies. What are some of y’alls theories about why they didn’t show up in the last 3 movies? - I understand that it was the Skywalker saga. But it feels like those two are at least important enough to the galaxy far far away, that they at least deserved to get mentioned."
979,1593112041.0,StarWarsTheories,"The Real-Life Force is Nuclear Power - Escapism is incredible. I enjoy when a story can transport to world where the impossible becomes real. Here’s a thought that I’ve been focusing on for a few days, what if the fantastical elements in our stories have real-world equivalents? My first case is how the force in Star Wars can is an analogy for nuclear power.

**The Force**

In Star Wars, the force binds all living beings together, it is life-force of the galaxy. It can be exploited for noble benevolent means, or corrupted for malevolent desires. Users can harness the force to further their knowledge or increase their power. Elements in tune with force, such as Kyber crystals can even be used to destroy entire planets.

The Jedi seek to balance this power and live in harmony with the living force, while the diametrically opposed Sith desire to weaponize the force and use it to rule and control.

**Nuclear Power**

Nuclear energy, likewise is all around us, it is the energy that binds the atoms of our makeup, without it we simply don’t exist. This energy can be used for good by providing power to those in need, but it can also be used for immense destruction.

Nations form relationships with this power. Some refuse to use its destructive nature and focus on the positive aspects, while others race to weaponize it to increase their military might.

**Conclusion**

Both the force and nuclear power have incredible potential for good and evil. These volatile powers are difficult to attain and understand, but with careful practice they can be harnessed. The mere presence of these energies has lead to incredible achievements, and inversely the world/galaxy’s greatest conflicts.

**TL:DR** Nuclear power is like the force as it can be used for the greater good, or incredible destruction."
980,1593033383.0,StarWarsTheories,"Darth Vader is just a sick joke - So, Emporor Palpatine knew that Anakin Skywalker was going to have children, and he likely knew (or at least predicted) that Anakin was going to kill Padme, likely before she gave birth to the children, despite the fact his goal was to avoid her death, its also documented that Darth Vader means ""dark father"" so, I believe Palpatine gave Anakin the name ""Darth Vader"" as a sick, cruel joke, a constant reminder that he failed to save the person he loved, not to mention is unborn children (remember up until episode 5 Vader didn't know that Luke was his son and assumed that he killed both Padme and their unborn children) it definitely seems like the kind of sick, cruel and twisted thing Palpatine would do.

I dont know if i explained this well, and yes, i know that, once again, i posted something that technically isn't a theory, but I wanted to share it and thought this was the best place it belonged"
981,1593022685.0,StarWarsTheories,What do y’all think? - 
982,1593007224.0,StarWarsTheories,"Why SNOKE should have been PLAGUEIS - Disclaimer:  I haven’t read any other theories on Snoke being Plagueis. So if there  are similarities to other theories, I apologize. I came up with this  theory about a month after Force Awakens (2015) premiered in Austria -  I’m still new to reddit which is why I never published it. But here we  go:

So  to unterstand everything, we need to go back - before Episode 1. As we  all know, Plagueis was Sidious’ Master. And we all know that Sidious’  killed Plagueis in his sleep - ironic. It’s ironic, because Plagueis  could save others from death by manipulating the midichlorians (which is  eventually the reason for the whole Jedi holocaust), but he couldn’t  save himself from dying.

But Plagueis could also create completely new life. So imagine this:

What  if Plagueis found the ability to create new life while training  Sidious? Plagueis would’ve seen the potential in creating the ultimate  Sith Lord, but - since the „rule of two“, he would therefore have to  kill his current apprentice: Darth Sidious. Since Sith aren’t known to  be very heart-warming, he started planning out to kill Sidious and  later-on raise the ultimate Sith Lord (Darth Vader) and take over the  galaxy as the leader of a new empire.

One  night, Sidious might’ve heard his master talking about this idea and  became jealous and angry (Sidious is only human too, and Sith/Humans  react emotionally and instinctively) - and therefore killed Plagueis to  take his place.

But  what if Plagueis DID save himself from dying, but it took almost all of  his power which is why he vanished for several years. While he  recovered from saving himself, he had to watch his old apprentice taking  over his place and living the life he always wanted. His apprentice  became the emperor of the galaxy and sat on the throne that was  originally supposed to be Plagueis’.

Of  course, Plagueis was pissed and jealous, but he still wanted to live  this life since he planned it so well. When Sidious died, he saw his  chance. Unfortunately, saving his own life costed so much energy that he  didn’t have enough power left to create a new Vader. That’s why he took  his closest offspring - his grand-son (because Luke obviously stated  that he wouldn’t turn to the dark side).

That  would also explain why Snoke was so disappointed with Kylo and  literally said „You’re no Vader“. It’s not because he wanted him to stop  acting like a whiny fangirl, but rather because Plagueis was incredibly  disappointed in his second failure. It was more of a self-hate /  disappointment. And he realized that. (Came to that conclusion after  TLJ, obviously).

But then came „The Rise of Skywalker“ and threw away my ideas.

No hate to Episode 9, it’s entertaining. But the plot could’ve been better."
983,1592984248.0,StarWarsTheories,"Why did Obi-Wan lie about Darth Vader killing Anakin - So, we know that Obi-Wan, was the one to give Luke to Owen and Beru as the empire rose to power, we also know that he watched over Luke for the following 19 years up until ""A New Hope,"" he cared for Luke deeply and couldn't stand to tell him that, in fact, he gave up on Anakin, his friend, his brother, Luke's father, so he told him that Darth Vader killed him, hoping that Luke wouldn't find out the truth, we know, of course, that Luke does find out that Darth Vader and Anakin Skywalker are one and the same, so, naturally he asks Obi-Wan why he lied, Obi-Wan gives him the whole ""it wasn't technically a lie"" thing, i think he did this, still, to cover up that he just couldn't bare to see Luke's disappointed in him, Luke thought so fondly of Obi-Wan, he didn't want Luke to think of him differently, he didn't want Luke to think badly about him. I think he also didn't want to tell Luke the reasons Anakin chose to become Vader, he didn't want Luke to think badly of his father either.


Ok, this isn't really a theory, more just speculation and head Canon, but i think it's a cool idea, and deepens the relationship between all three of them.

I hope you like this idea, it made me feel something when rewatching the movies again with this in mind"
984,1592980839.0,StarWarsTheories,"Just hear me out - So I recently had this thought- What if Star Wars is based on Ancient Rome? 

As you may or may not know, there are three periods of Roman History: Regal, Republican and Imperial. Sound familiar yet?

In the Regal period, there are various huts and small villages. Just like the Legends comic and book series Dawn of the Jedi. (Great read BTW). Next is the Republican era, which we see in the KOTOR and TOR games, the TOR books and most notably, The Prequels (TPM, AOTS, ROTS). This is the longest period in both Ancient Rome and Star Wars. The final era is the Imperial period. We see this in The Original Trilogy (Star Wars, ESB, ROTJ) and a form of the Empire in the Sequel Trilogy: The First Order.

And that's my theory. It isn't a mind-blowing theory that changes everything, but it is something to think about."
985,1592875288.0,StarWarsTheories,"Marshal Commanders knew of order 66 - A marshal commander is the highest rank a clone can get, I believe. There's two I would like to discuss: Cody and Fox. 

So we know from Clone Wars S7 that Rex could slightly rebel his chip, as he told Ahsoka to find his file on Fives' discovery of order 66. We know Captain Rex had a strong friendship with both Anakin and Ahsoka, so this is probably why he held back.  

Another clone who had a strong friendship with a Jedi was Commander Cody, who was also one of the highest ranking clones in general. However, Cody doesn't hesitate a bit to shoot down Obi-Wan, even muttering under his breath wishing that he got the order before giving him back his lightsaber. It seems weird he so easily betrayed a friend, as Rex showed that he could fight back ever so slightly. But he didn't. 

I think Cody was told about Order 66 from the beginning, as it makes sense to tell a marshal commander about their biggest plan. This means Cody knew and betrayed Obi-Wan's trust from the start. 

Also, when Fives discovered the plot to kill the Jedi, Fox could (and should) have set his blaster to stun. But then what? Fives would tell the Jedi and Palpatine's plans would be thwarted. Fox HAD to kill him, as Fives knew of Order 66. They couldn't risk letting that secret out."
986,1592833384.0,StarWarsTheories,"**The jedi order is a oppressive cult that limits force users power. **It is only those who forsake the order that achieve true power. - Here's a wild one. What if the jedi order was not created to help the light side users but to limit their power. 

I noticed a trend when rewatching the movies. The characters that achieve the greatest level of power or balance in the force seem to be those who have turned away from the jedi teachings or reject the order altogether . The grey jedis .

Here are some examples.

Qui gon jinn: He is a part of the order but he is apart from the order . He frequently disagrees with the council and the council considers him a grey jedi. heres a intreasting  quote to further cement the point. 

""If you would just follow the Code, you would be on the Council. They will not go along with you this time.""
""You still have much to learn, my young
 apprentice.""
-OBI-WAN KENOBI AND QUI-GON JINN

Jinn understood that achieving balance in the force had nothing to do with following the beauracrity of the jedi order. He is also the only one to trust the force and recognize anakin as the chosen one.
power achieved: immortality through force ghost, ability  to see the chosen one.

Ashoka tano:
Ashoka abadoned the jedi order but the force did not abandon her. In fact she appears to get stronger after she leaves. She even stands toe to toe with vader in rebels and maul in TCW. Not only does she master the saber after leaving the order but her visions and force perception become stronger as evidenced many times in rebels and the last season of TCW. 
Power achieved: advanced sabre mastery and force attunement.

Luke skywalker : 
Our old boy luke is never really a jedi in the traditional sense but he knows the ways. He struggles to follow the code but it is often in breaking the jedi code and trusting the force that he finds success .

Most of lukes sucess comes from the force not adherence to the jedi code. In ANW he takes down the death star, IN ESB he force pulls his saber and calls to Leia.  But his main success comes from defeating vader .When he tries to play the stoic jedi he is weak, limited and misguided. It is only through tapping into dark side and his anger that he is able to bring down his father. 
Furthermore in the sequel trilogy it is after luke has Forsaken the jedi code on acht- to that he is able to achieve his greatest trick, force projection.
His greatest failure in contrast is his betrayal of his nephew while a practicing jedi master . 
Power achieved: force projection.

Anakin Skywalker:
What can i say about old annie? Well,  the stoic jedi code never really sat well with him. Hes an emotional  guy and thats ok. He wants to love and feel. He wants to have people to care about. He plays by his own rules most of the prequels.  Thats what makes him so powerful and thats why the council is so afraid of him. His love for padme and obi wan and his unborn children are what make him stronger but the jedi wish to suppress him.it is this denial of his true nature that leads to him turning on the jedi. He Becomes unbalanced because of the jedi code . It is not natural to supress ones feelings and the force is a natural  entity .
Power achieved: prophetic visions, unlimited,  although brief, power. 

The examples go the other way as well. Yoda, dooku, obi wan and mace are all weak in the force and blinded by the strict confines of the code. This is why the sith are able to rise . 

In conclusion maybe the true balance of the force is not jedi or sith philosophy but a balance and trust in the force. A neutral mixture of light and dark. 

But the question remains,  why limit the jedi? why create a whole system to limit their power. And who is behind it?

What do you think. Is the jedi order just as oppressive as the sith?  Can you think of any more jedi stronger with the code?"

988,1592781711.0,StarWarsTheories,"What’s gonna happen to baby Yoda? - What would y’all like to see happen to Baby Yoda’s character in The Mandolorian? Would it bother y’all if it turns out that he’s actually related to Yoda somehow? Personally, I wouldn’t mind either way. I just know that as long as they don’t do him like they did Luke, give him a name ASAP because I’m tired of calling him “Baby Yoda”, and especially don’t make him a clone. Then I’ll probably be pleased with the outcome."
989,1592720611.0,StarWarsTheories,"Yoda is responsible for the fall of anakin Skywalker - So here we go with this one. Our little green guy might be a little more at fault they previously thought. 

Sometime before the events of the phantom menace  i believe that Yoda and the jedi masters had lost their connection to the force.  They know it and are hiding it . The order had become a cult more focused on bureaucracy and the rules governing the code of the jedi than the spiritual connection to the force.

 But does it go deeper.

It was not that the dark side ""clouded"" their visions . The jedis vision have been clouded by their own spiritual distance from the force.
This is why they can not see that papletine is a sith. That is why they struggle to properly guide the fledgling Anakin. It is why Yoda and the other masters are so easily defeated by sidious and order 66.

The jedi are are more concerned about losing position in the republic than the balance of the force. It is a unspoken shame between the jedi masters. A lie they keep up to stay revelant in the government.  They know if the secret is revealed the people will lose faith in the jedi.

 That is why the council is so afraid and dissmissive of Anakin, he has a true connection to the force, something they no longer have. It reminds them that they are imposters.  They can use the tricks but the connection is severed. 

The only time the force ""helps"" them out is to help  anakin to his destiny . When yoda is able to best dooku the force uses yoda to protect anakin. When mace defeats sidious in his office it is because anakins destiny is to choose the dark side.

The only exception is obi wan,  he is force neutral.  He is also naive and unaware ,until later , of the jedis true failing.

This is why yoda exiles away in dagobah.  Its his shame . He failed to properly guide the struggling anakin.  If he had worried less about appearances and more about the force , he could have prevented anakin's fall. 
He failed to protect the republic.  He valued his own pride and piety.  Yoda was more afraid of losing the jedi order than following the will of the force. It was his apathy that lead to anakins fall and the rise of the sith. 

What do you guys think?"
990,1592716364.0,StarWarsTheories,"Rey is not the chosen one to balance the force. Rey is the"" balance "" of the force. - In the star wars series there seems to be a major theme that runs throughout.  Skywalker vs palpatine in a struggle for the fate of the force. In the prequels palpatine wins when he turns anakin. In the OT it is reversed when luke Skywalker turns vader.  

But heres where it gets intreasting . Rey is a biological  palpatine but has chosen to follow the skywalker path. She is both a palpatine and a skywalker.

So if the paletines and skywalkers have represented the opposite side of the force, Rey is the balance of the two. 

So Rey is the physical, biological and spiritual representative of the ""balance ""of the force. Anakin is still  the chosen one but  Rey is the end result. The  ""balance""  of anakins actions and legacy."
