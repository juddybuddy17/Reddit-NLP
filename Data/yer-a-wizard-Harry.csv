0,1697753315.0,HarryPotterBooks,I find the scene where Hedwig is indignant with Harry quite funny - Hedwig is really sweet and really cares about Harry and she really has personality. I just reread the chapter where Harry isn’t able to use Hedwig to write to Sirius as Sirius has told him it brings too much attention. Hedwig likes to deliver letters for Harry and feels affronted about this and she lets Harry know it. I just find it quite funny and Harry is all like Ron and I are fighting and now me and you as well. Then there are so many moments where she is very affectionate with him and at Privet Drive especially she is his only companion
1,1697736043.0,HarryPotterBooks,"Polyjuice Potion - I'm reading the books again, and I just came across a possible contradiction. Polyjuice Potion is not intended for transformation into non-humans or you will have adverse effects. They state at one point that Hagrid didn't need to be vetted because there's no way someone could have turned into him with polyjuice potion.

In that thought process, does it work the other way around? Fleur is 1/4 Veela, and she can drink the potion and successfully turn into Harry, but apparently a 1/2 giant is off the table?

If there's a nuance I missed, please let me know! I'm just confused if the no non-human rule only applies to what you're transforming into."

4,1697723773.0,HarryPotterBooks,"The Trace - We know all kids under the age of 17 have the trace.  We also know attending a school to learn magic isn't compulsory until Voldemort takes charge.  Which means there were kids under the age of 17 allowed to use magic outside of school.  We also know the trace detects magic around kids, but that it's up to the parents/guardians to enforce the rules.  Which means the trace only really policed wizards living in a muggle household.  Was the trace a form of muggleborn discrimination?"
5,1697718276.0,HarryPotterBooks,"Walburga Black - What do you think she was like? I know many say that there’s no evidence that she abused Sirius. 

However: 
A) Sirius knew that he could withstand the cruciatus curse and not crack. He probably had some experience with it prior to joining the Order. Do I think it would have happened before he got sorted into Gryffindor? No, prior to that, he would have been disciplined without the cruciatus curse but disciplined nonetheless. I guess the exception would be if he was ballsy enough to question blood purity ideology (like point out how it doesn’t make sense or something). If Walburga herself didn’t do it(or possibly Orion, but Sirius seems to focus on her), then I think she at least allowed Bellatrix to do so. 

B) Being locked up in Grimmauld Place was incredibly hard on Sirius. I think it was a combination of the location and the fact that he couldn’t leave and was by himself/isolated a lot(except for Kreacher and his mother’s portrait, which only exacerbated things). 

What do you think?"

HOWEVER, I cannot stop thinking about this one. At the end of GOF, McGonagall and Snape are guarding Barty Crouch JR when Fudge arrives to question Crouch with a dementor for protection.

He reassures the students and the wizarding world that they must stand united against darkness and adversity.

With Sirius he is alive and has gotten to know him. He and has seen Sirius and Snape interact hostilely as adults. He admires and respects and thinks very highly of him but he is aware Sirius is human and I think Sirius is real, flawed and imperfect to him in a way his father was not at this point.

Bulgaria is geographically close to these (former) countries, but I don't know anything about it, so I can't judge these names for myself.)

16,1697643306.0,HarryPotterBooks,"What are some of the biggest misconceptions in the series - 
Either because of the movies, fanfics or because people haven't read the series in a while what are the biggest misconceptions people have about the series? 

I will start the magic protecting Harry at the Dursleys isn't the same as the one that protects him in book 1. This is a simple mistake to make since both magics are so closely linked together but in reality both are a bit distinct from each other. First there's lily's sacrifice done when she was murdered which lives in Harry and is forever. That's the one that defends Harry in boom 1 and voldy tries to bypass in book 4. 

>“Your mother died to save you. If there is one thing Voldemort cannot understand, it is love. He didn’t realize that love as powerful as your mother’s for you leaves its own mark. Not a scar, no visible sign… to have been loved so deeply, even though the person who loved us is gone, will give us some protection forever. It is in your very skin. Quirrell, full of hatred, greed, and ambition, sharing his soul with Voldemort, could not touch you for this reason. It was agony to touch a person marked by something so good.”  

As you can see this one was a once and done deal and didn't need him to do anything to keep it up he was protected forever that's why he was protected from the avada kedavra in book 7 after the protection around the Dursleys home was broken. 

>“Precisely!” said Dumbledore. “He took your blood and rebuilt his living body with it! Your blood in his veins, Harry, Lily’s protection inside both of you! He thethered you to life while he lives!”   

>“He took your blood believing it would strengthen him. He took into his body a tiny part of the enchantment your mother laid upon you when she died for you. His body keeps her sacrafice alive, and while that enchantment survives, so do you and so does Voldemort’s one last hope for himself.”  

The second one is a charm created by Dumbledore the night Harry was left at the Dursleys to use the protection that surrounds Harry to protect him while he lives there this only worked because petunia shares his blood.

> “But I knew too where Voldemort was weak. And so I made my decision. You would be protected by an ancient magic of which he knows, which he despises, and which he has always, therefore,  underestimated — to his cost. I am speaking, of course, of the fact that your mother died to save you. She gave you a lingering protection he never expected, a protection that flows in your veins to this day. I put my trust, therefore, in your mother’s blood. I delivered you to her sister, her only remaining relative.”   

> “But she took you,” Dumbledore cut across him. “She may have taken you grudgingly, furiously, unwillingly, bitterly, yet still she took you, and in doing so, she sealed the charm I placed upon you. Your mother’s sacrifice made the bond of blood the strongest shield I could give you.”  

This is why Harry returns to the Dursleys in the last three books the protection voldy bypassed was lily's protection (sort of he still was protected to an extend) but him having his blood wasn't enough to actually bypass the protection that surrounded the Dursleys home."
17,1697591822.0,HarryPotterBooks,Order Of the Phoenix - Trelawney - I just was reading the chapter where Professor Trelawney gets sacked and realized... Dumbledore probably didn't want her to leave the grounds because he was afraid of the Death Eaters getting their hands on her in the hopes of getting the prophesy that way. I mean he certainly didn't protest when Hargrid disappeared.
18,1697577354.0,HarryPotterBooks,"Do you think muggles can experience magical methods of transport? - There’s no evidence of this in the books that I know of so purely looking for opinions here.

- Do you think a magical person could bring a muggle along with sidealong apparition or would the muggle just get left behind?
- If a muggle threw floo powder into a floo-connected fireplace, would it take them where they wanted to go or would they just stay where they are?
- If they sat on a broomstick, could they make it fly?

My theories:

- Yes, but there’s a seriously high probability of splinching.
- It might work, but potentially only if a magical person said the destination name, if the speaking of the destination acts as a spell incantation.
- They could sit on a broom that’s already in the air, but they can’t control it.

Any other thoughts?"

Later in the same book, Seamus and Dean ask him to chip in money for a party because they found someone who would sell them firewhisky. This leads me to believe that it’s restricted by age, likely that you must be of age to purchase it. Which begs the question that is driving me crazy: how do they know if you’re of age? It’s not like Aberforth knows when Ron’s 17th birthday is, and they don’t have physical ID as far as I know, so they could just lie, couldn’t they? There has to be an answer and it’s killing me.

In various descriptions from the books it was said that you can get lost at Hogwarts, sometimes you don't know how to get from one place to another, going from floor to floor often means getting lost in the thicket of corridors and corners. Here it seems super simple, just stay in the Grand Staircase from the bottom and you easily know how to get to the top. Not to mention great heights and the possibility of falling?

\- on each floor there is a mixture of corridors, stairs, nooks, corners, hidden passages, secrets, darkness, clues. There is no common hub. (This is version in my imagination)

\- other solution?

27,1697438039.0,HarryPotterBooks,"Was Mr. Weasley in Griffindor? - I always thought the Weasleys were all Griffindors. But, in GOF, Mrs. Weasley talks about going on a midnight stroll with Mr. Weasley. It seems she came back to Griffindor Tower by herself because the Fat Lady gave her a telling off and Mr. Weasley isn’t mentioned. But, in the same memory, she speaks about Mr. Weasley getting caught by the care taker, but doesn’t mention that she was caught. So, were they in different houses? Did they split up after the midnight stroll and retire to their separate houses? Why wouldn’t the Fat Lady have given him a telling off as well?

I don’t think the whole Order really thought Harry at least would go back. I know Lupin and Arthur at least were said to have dropped asking them their plans, so some of the Order knew and accepted that they were not going back. I can understand why Molly and Hagrid would be the most likely to want them to go…but like, did they even know who the next headmaster would be? How could they possibly plan to just let Harry go back to school, after all the trouble and protections they’d gone through and had to create by then?

I know the ministry hadn’t fallen yet, but it still seems a little ridiculous to even consider sending Harry to Hogwarts. Especially considering that it was only thought to be so safe because Dumbledore was there, and that death eaters had broken in just months before.

It might have just been wishful thinking, them trying to imagine that everything is as normal as can be. I dunno, what do you think?"

34,1697337196.0,HarryPotterBooks,"Dying for a loved one as protection - I'm not sure which book we learned this in, but we find out in one of the earlier books that Harry survived Voldemort's killing curse due to his mother dying for him. As Dumbledore explains to Harry, her sacrifice acted as an enchantment to protect him. 
We then find out in the last book, Harry's selfless act of willing to die to get rid of the last bit of Voldemort,  but to also protect his friends, ultimately protected then from Voldemort.  As Harry informed him, ""I've done what my mother did. They're protected from you. Haven't you noticed how non of the spells you put on them are binding? You can't torture them. You can't touch them""(Deathly Hallows pg. 738),
Seems the logic is as follows: If someone dies to protect another, that person should be immune to Voldemort forever. I'm sure that during the many years of Voldemort's reign, there were a lot of family members dying for each other. Why are non of these relatives mentioned as immune? Or better yet, was Harry really the first one Voldemort encountered who had someone die for him, therefore the one to have the killing curse rebounded on him? 
Just hard to believe that no one else died for their loved one when when attacked by Voldemort and if it was true for Voldemort,  shouldn't this magical enchantment have been true for Grindlewald and all other evil wizards who like to kill? Yet, this is the first rebound killing curse to have ever happened."

37,1697302960.0,HarryPotterBooks,"Continuity goofs and possible explanations? - What’s a continuity issue that really irks you that you’ve made up a plausible explanation for? 

One of mine is when Figg is questioned at Harry’s trial in OoP. She isn’t able to see the dementors but can describe their effect properly. I feel like this is at odds with Filch being at Hogwarts while the dementors are posted there. We never see him interact with them, but there aren’t any issues of him having run ins with them either. Filch navigates through the rest of the magic at Hogwarts so I feel like it would be off for him to not be able to see dementors. He can’t produce magic without tools like Secrecy Sensors, but he can interact with it. 

Edit to add/clarify: Figg *says* she can see them, but describes them very poorly until she gets to how they affect the environment, which we know muggles can sense because Dudley did as well. Harry is sure Figg has never seen a dementor other than in pictures because of how badly she describes them visually. Fudge isn’t convinced, but Bones is because she was able to describe the coldness and fear. 

My explanation for this is that Squibs either:

A. Have a range of magical ability. Maybe Filch has more magic in him than Figg, and that’s why he can’t purely live with muggles. 
Figg is just on the lower end of that scale and it was kinder to let her live as a muggle than as a second class citizen in the wizarding world. 

Or B: for squibs, ability of interact with magic depends on exposure. Figg leads a mostly muggle life, so her ability to see things like dementors has diminished. Filch is constantly around magic so while he still can’t produce any, he has a better ability to see it than other squibs."

52,1697142535.0,HarryPotterBooks,"What did Dumbledore mean when he told Voldemort there are things worse than death? - &#x200B;

What do you think he meant when he said that to Voldemort and in the King's Cross chapter to Harry?

I think it should be interpreted in different ways. Here is my attempt. (I am aware this is related to religion and spirituality.)

* Dumbledore's personal history. Living a life of regret because of his sister. Makes me sad if I think I have to consider this interpretation.
* Dumbledore knows that Voldemort's horcruxses will leave him with a stunted soul part in the after life.
* What about ghosts? Nearly-headless Nick evaluates his continued existence as 'deprived'. I guess Dumbledore with his keen psychological insight might have been aware about the feelings of the Ghosts of Hogwarts about their decision to become ghosts, and whether they would choosen it again.
* J.K. Rowling is a non-convential Christian and she writes like one. ""The last enemy that shall be destroyed is death."" I mean, a Sufi or a Buddhist could not write Deathly Hallows, even if they tried. Should we also incorporate Christian interpretations?

I am not sure what readers are meant to get from this psychologically? What can readers with a more atheistic worldview (no personal god or afterlife) learn from the point that Dumbledore maeks? What lessons can readers learn from him about dealing with their own mortality?

I think one has to consider it maybe in a different way.

Immortality of his own ego, in the way that Voldemort pursues with Horcruxes, is essentially wrong. It is better to live further through one's kids, or maybe philosophically for some, like Dumbledore and perhaps Snape, through some rememberance for with they did (the point about Snape is maybe controversally, but I include it anyway). Harry faces his own death, but in the epilogue he has his own children. Harry will die some die, but he will live forth through his children."
53,1697199375.0,HarryPotterBooks,"Was Lily Evans really good at Potions? - I'm sure people asked this question before, but it's worth repeating.  Was Lily really great at Potions or is it because she was best friend to Severus Snape?

To clarify.  Harry Potter was praised by Slughorn for being just like his mother, however Harry was just copying alternate instructions in the half prince's book.  That book originally belong to Snape's mother.

On one hand, you can consider that young Snape benefit from his friendship with Lily and gotten better at Potions, or it could be that Lily benefited from her friendship with Severus and got better.

Considering how Slughorn praised Harry; is there room to consider the same thing happened with Lily, with Snape having no problems with her copying his work because he likes her a lot?

I understand people wanting to dedicate Lily's achievement in potions by her own merits, but between her and Snape, one of them had a mother who was *super* great at potions.  And there's no rules against mixing potions during the summer.

Correction, Snape's mother wasn't super good at potion.  I remembered that incorrectly."

Edit: I know that's my point, they don't need these things to change their appearance but they still use it like in the seven Potters, you have the STRONGEST wizards alive second only to Dumbledore and Voldy so like why use Polyjuice Potion that would have been started to be brewed months before this or in the case of Barty Crouch jr.

58,1697072935.0,HarryPotterBooks,"Unpopular opinion - really dislike the audio books - Basically what it says in the title. I've only seen praise for the audiobooks and while I can appreciate that both Jim Dale and Stephen Fry are incredible and their work is super impressive, I can't really stand listening to them. 

The narration is lovely but as for the characters, it just sounds really wrong to me that the voices of the children are those of adult / elderly sounding men. It really takes away from how the main characters come across. I do admit it sounds great for some of the older characters though. 

The dialogue sounds really unnatural, especially for the age group they're reading, and unnecessarily dramatic. I prefer Fry's voices, Dale does some good ones but Luna, Hermione and Bellatrix are horrid. I'd love listening to the books some time because they're a huge comfort for me, but the voices make them feel like a completely different book to me. 

I generally don't listen to many audio books, so it might just be a narration style I personally dislike or am not used to, and maybe that's why it sounds so odd to me. 

I'm really interested to know if anyone feels the same about them or if I'm just weird about it! :) "
59,1697058391.0,HarryPotterBooks,"Previously unnoticed parallel btwn Harry & Ginny and James & Lily - In CoS when Harry discovers Ginny’s body on the ground in the Chamber, he throws aside his wand and runs to her side hoping she isn’t dead. Tom Riddle then picks up his wand and uses it as they go into the final battle with the basilisk. 
 
I realized that this parallels to when James and Lily are found by Voldemort. Voldemort muses about how James doesn’t have his wand on him when James leaves the room, and how one should never feel safe or be unprotected without their wand. James doesn’t pick up his wand when he attempts to warn and protect Lily from Voldemort when Voldemort enters their home. 

It’s just a subtle parallel that I thought was touching and interesting; both James and Harry rely on love (or comfort, or relationships, what have you) in protecting their partners. Both times Voldemort scoffs at this, but both times he is defeated. 

A question this prompts for me is: did the memory of Tom Riddle record this occurrence of both Potter men discarding their wands? I doubt it because the diary horacrux was made prior to his downfall at Godrick’s Hollow, and we learn in DH that ‘alive’ Voldemort isn’t sensitive to his horacruxes. What an interesting thing for Voldemort to miss! I don’t know if Voldemort would have been better off with this knowledge, but I highly doubt it."
60,1697051349.0,HarryPotterBooks,"Harry develops a lot when it comes to standing up for his friends. - At the beginning of the series, Harry is starved of love and attention. Because of this, whenever his friends fought -- he would never take sides or get involved in any kind of interpersonal conflict because he was so afraid to lose them.

Like in Prisoner of Azkaban, when Hermione and Ron had their first big fight. While Harry clearly wanted them to be friends again, he wasn't confident in broaching the issue with Ron:

>There was no arguing with this, as Ron chose that moment to say loudly, ""If Scabbers hadn’t just been eaten, he could have had some of these Fudge Flies, he used to really like them –""

>Hermione burst into tears. Before Harry could say or do anything, she had tucked the enormous book under her arm, and, still sobbing, ran towards the staircase to the girls’ dormitories and out of sight.

>""Can’t you give her a break?"" Harry asked Ron **quietly.**

Notice that bolded word? **Quietly.**

I honestly think both Ron and Hermione had points here, but Harry never pressed too hard on getting them to reconcile. 

The cycle repeats itself in Goblet of Fire, after Hermione and Ron have an even larger blowout over Hermione going out with Krum.

>“This whole tournament’s supposed to be about getting to know
foreign wizards and making friends with them!” said Hermione
hotly.

>“No it isn’t!” shouted Ron. “It’s about winning!”

>People were starting to stare at them.

>“Ron,” said Harry **quietly,** “I haven’t got a problem with
Hermione coming with Krum —”

>But Ron ignored Harry too. 

The interesting thing here to me is that the word ""Quietly"" shows up again. It tends to crop up when Harry disagrees with how Ron is handling something, but is loathe to voice his true feelings aloud for fear of what it would do to their friendship.

>[Hermione]: “Next time there’s a ball, ask me before someone else does, and not as a last resort!”

>Ron mouthed soundlessly like a goldfish out of water as
Hermione turned on her heel and stormed up the girls’ staircase to
bed. Ron turned to look at Harry.

>“Well,” he sputtered, looking thunderstruck, “well — that just
proves — completely missed the point —”

>**Harry didn’t say anything.** He liked being back on speaking
terms with Ron too much to speak his mind right now — *but he
somehow thought that Hermione had gotten the point much better than Ron had.*

So we have the pattern. What is interesting is that it's not even related to *just* Ron and Hermione. This also extends to Harry's other valued relationships. Fred and George for example. He values the twins a great deal, and almost always agrees or appreciates them. 

But, in Order of the Phoenix, we see that Harry privately agrees with Hermione when they're testing their product on first-years.

>“No, I’m sorry, they’ve gone too far,” [Hermione] said, standing up and looking positively furious. “Come on, Ron.”

>“I — what?” said Ron, plainly playing for time. “No — come on,
Hermione — we can’t tell them off for giving out sweets. . . .”

>“You know perfectly well that those are bits of Nosebleed Nougat
or — or Puking Pastilles or —”

>“Fainting Fancies?” Harry suggested **quietly.** 

Here we have Harry literally siding with Hermione, and dispelling Ron's lie that the twins are just handing out ""sweets."" It's interesting to me that Harry also sees that the twins have clearly crossed a line, and is backing Hermione up -- albeit quietly.

But then, in Half-Blood Prince, we see a turn. Harry in this book is more confident, more mature, and in many ways more well-adjusted. In Ron and Hermione's fight, he is doing everything to be the mature one in the trio by trying to defend one from the other.

Like after Ron makes fun of Hermione in class, and she runs out without her stuff.

>Harry, deciding that [Hermione's] need was greater than Ron’s just now, scooped up her remaining possessions and followed her.
He finally tracked her down as she emerged from a girls’ bathroom on the floor below. She was accompanied by Luna Lovegood,
who was patting her vaguely on the back.

>“Oh, hello, Harry,” said Luna. “Did you know one of your eyebrows is bright yellow?”

>“Hi, Luna. Hermione, you left your stuff. . . .”
He held out her books.

>“Oh yes,” said Hermione in a choked voice, taking her things
and turning away quickly to hide the fact that she was wiping her
eyes on her pencil case. “Thank you, Harry. Well, I’d better get going. . . .”

>And she hurried off, without giving Harry any time to offer
words of comfort, though admittedly he could not think of any. 

The really cool part is that Harry doesn't just stop there -- he challenges and shames Ron for his actions.

>“You could say sorry,” suggested Harry **bluntly.**

>“What, and get attacked by another flock of canaries?” muttered
Ron.

>“What did you have to imitate her for?”

>“She laughed at my mustache!”

>“So did I, it was the stupidest thing I’ve ever seen.” 

He's being blunt, now. Not quiet.

Earlier in the book, he stops Ron and Ginny from fighting:

>Ron had pulled out his wand too; Harry stepped swiftly between
them. 

>“You don’t know what you’re talking about!” Ron roared, trying
to get a clear shot at Ginny around Harry, who was now standing
in front of her with his arms outstretched. “Just because I don’t do
it in public — !”

>Ginny screamed with derisive laughter, trying to push Harry out
of the way.

>“Been kissing Pigwidgeon, have you? Or have you got a picture
of Auntie Muriel stashed under your pillow?”

>“You—”

>A streak of orange light flew under Harry’s left arm and missed
Ginny by inches; Harry pushed Ron up against the wall. 

>Harry: **“Don’t be stupid —”**

>...

>And with that, she stormed away. Harry quickly let go of Ron;
the look on his face was murderous. They both stood there, breathing heavily, until Mrs. Norris, Filch’s cat, appeared around the corner, which broke the tension. 

And then he has a frank discussion with Ron later on after Ron is verbally berating the Quidditch Team:

>“ENOUGH!” bellowed Harry, who had seen Ginny glowering
in Ron’s direction and, remembering her reputation as an accomplished caster of the Bat-Bogey Hex, soared over to intervene before things got out of hand. “Peakes, go and pack up the Bludgers. Demelza, pull yourself together, you played really well today. Ron . . .” he waited until the rest of the team were out of earshot before saying it, **“you’re my best mate, but carry on treating the rest of them like this and I’m going to kick you off the team.”**

>**He really thought for a moment that Ron might hit him, but then something much worse happened:** Ron seemed to sag on his broom; all the fight went out of him and he said, “I resign. I’m pathetic.” 

I really like Harry's development here. He becomes a more well rounded person who had the ability to call his friends out."
61,1697030508.0,HarryPotterBooks,"Tom Riddle’s pursuit of immortality began in response to what happened after he opened the Chamber of Secrets (the first time) - Tom’s formative years at Hogwarts weren’t spent, at first, on a quest to live forever, but to find his family:

> *“Those whom I could persuade to talk told me that Riddle was obsessed with his parentage. This is understandable, of course; he had grown up in an orphanage and naturally wished to know how he came to be there[…] All he had to go upon was the single name ‘Marvolo,’ which he knew from those who ran the orphanage had been his mother’s father’s name. Finally, after painstaking research through old books of Wizarding families, he discovered the existence of Slytherin’s surviving line. In the summer of his sixteenth year, he left the orphanage to which he returned annually and set off to find his Gaunt relatives. And now, Harry, if you will stand . . .”*

Finding the Chamber of Secrets the following year was the culmination of this long effort. This is Riddle’s memory, speaking to Harry fifty years later:

> *I thought someone must realize that Hagrid couldn’t possibly be the Heir of Slytherin. It had taken me five whole years to find out everything I could about the Chamber of Secrets and discover the secret entrance . . . as though Hagrid had the brains, or the power!*

Voldemort believes he is claiming his birthright by opening the Chamber, it is his stated goal to fulfill Salazar Slytherin’s legacy: 

> *“I knew it wouldn’t be safe to open the Chamber again while I was still at school. But I wasn’t going to waste those long years I’d spent searching for it. I decided to leave behind a diary, preserving my sixteen-year-old self in its pages, so that one day, with luck, I would be able to lead another in my footsteps, and finish Salazar Slytherin’s noble work.”*

But the opening of the Chamber went disastrously for young Tom. Though there were many attacks on muggle-borns, things quickly got out of hand with the death of a young girl. The same night Riddle learned the school might close because of his actions, he framed Hagrid. But as noted above, Riddle could hardly believe that others accepted Hagrid as the culprit. He’s astounded to have gotten away with it, but yet, he’s resolved to leave the diary so that he could return later to his “noble work.”

The Chamber of Secrets fiasco inspired the Horcrux quest, and in some sense kicked off the entire plot. In a rare moment of humility, Voldemort seems to have acknowledged that his plans were fallible. With a little more carelessness, he might have been caught and sent to Azkaban, or given the Dementor’s Kiss, or even killed. His obsession with his heritage nearly destroyed his life, and he needed more planning and caution. 

So he made backups in the Horcruxes. Found supporters in the Death Eaters. Supporters who would serve him and facilitate the transformation into a pure-blood society. It’s likely no coincidence that his symbol, the Dark Mark, resembles the basilisk coming out of the statue of Salazar Slytherin: 

> *Something huge hit the stone floor of the Chamber. Harry felt it shudder — he knew what was happening, he could sense it, could almost see the giant serpent uncoiling itself from Slytherin’s mouth.*

And:

> *Then he realized that it was a colossal skull, comprised of what looked like emerald stars, with a serpent protruding from its mouth like a tongue.*

Voldemort’s cult has always been the cult of Salazar Slytherin. The cult of pure-blood supremacy. It’s easy to forget that the whole Potter thing happened some *forty years* into Voldemort’s career as a Dark Lord, and was basically just a gigantic wrench in his plans."

80,1696733974.0,HarryPotterBooks,"Some thoughts on Voldy Snape relationship - I have been thinking about this for a while and the more I think, the more I find the relationship between Voldy and Snape intriguing.

We don't know too much about the past (except Voldy having made an effort to uphold Snape's request of sparing Lilly), but we know that when Voldy gains his body back in GoF, he mentions that Snape is missing among the death eaters, and he suspects that Snape has left his service:

""...One, who I believe has left me for ever … he will be killed, of course...""

So here are a few interesting thoughts about what happens after this point:

- Snape, with Dumbledore's request, returns to Voldemort, and convinces him at least to continue to live to prove his loyalty. We are not given any information, but in my opinion he must have gone to him with an offering (such as important information that he and Dumbledore have agreed to give him). Very curious to know what it could be...

- Both Dumbledore and Snape knew that the day of Snape's double agency would come and probably have prepared for it over the years. I wonder if Dumbledore had helped Snape to master his occlumancy during that time, since he would be sending a man holding many of his secrets (despite his maximum secrecy) to the dark lord's side. 

- We don't know much about what exactly Snape was doing during OotP in terms of double agency, such as what information he was carrying to Voldy. No other OotP members were suspecting him, so not much indication of them looking for any leakage. 

- After HBP, we see that Voldy elevates Snape's position among the death eaters and I think he no longer doubts his loyalty (I think he would have said something about it at least right before killing him and he passed his test after all). So from Voldy's perspective, Snape actually had accomplished something no one else has done, including himself: truly and continuously decieving Dumbledore. Some may say Barty C Jr did the same, but he had the element of surprise and magical disguise on his side. What Snape had appeared to have done was convincing Dumbledore of his allegiance despite him knowing that he was serving the dark lord in the past and staying constantly next to Dumbledore during the 13 years afterwards. Voldy knew how hard it was to deceive Dumbledore, especially after he had seen one's true nature. In fact, Dumbledore was the only person he failed to deceive or charm as Tom. Looking at all this, I think Voldy must have had some form of respect for Snape. Maybe that is why he shared the magic of flying with him.

Just wanted to dump these thoughts here in case anybody finds them interesting enough to speculate."

Solution: >!Madam Malkin!<

84,1696708890.0,HarryPotterBooks,Harry and Lupin relationship in the books- why do you think there is this distance between them compared to Harry and Sirius - I actually really like their relationship and think it is fine if they are not as close as Harry and Sirius. They both respect and care for each other and Lupin was the person who taught him how to fight dementors and he asked Harry to be the godfather of his child so their relationship was clearly meaningful. I don’t think we can expect Lupin to be like Sirius. Lupin has a lot of self loathing and finds it hard to to let people in as he thinks people are better of without him and he has internalised a lot of the discrimination he has been subjected to his whole life. I think Harry growing up with the Dursley’s is not someone who is going to make the first step in situations like this. Sirius offered Harry the chance to move in with him and made it clear he wanted them to write to each other.

86,1696690464.0,HarryPotterBooks,"""Its A Children's Book Bro"" Is Just A Terrible Argument Against The Umbridge/Centaur Theory - The argument is just stupid.

Harry Potter (especially in the later parts of the story) became more mature. Torture is common practise both magical (The Cruciatus Curse) and physical (The Blood Quill). However, r\*pe does happen and is implied in other places. For Example:

***“We are, Sev, but I don’t like some of the people you’re hanging round with! I’m sorry, but I detest Avery and Mulciber! Mulciber! What do you see in him, Sev, he’s creepy! D’you know what he tried to do to Mary Macdonald the other day?***

**Lily had reached a pillar and leaned against it, looking up into the thin, sallow face.""**

The implication is there. He's a ""creep"" who tried to do something to a girl.

Not only that it's literal canon that Merope r\*ped Tom Riddle Snr. and Corvus Lestrange did the same to Laurena Kama just with imperio instead of a potion, but nah it's just a children's book bro no implications here.

It being a children's book does not mean purposeful subtext cannot be implied it'll just fly over the heads of children and those who don't know mythology, assuming she did imply r\*pe.

Read the extract again.

""***All six of them looked around. Professor Umbridge was lying in a bed opposite them, gazing up at the ceiling. Dumbledore had strode alone into the forest to rescue her from the centaurs. How he had done it — how he had emerged from the trees supporting Professor Umbridge without so much as a scratch on him — nobody knew, and Umbridge was certainly not telling. Since she had returned to the castle she had not, as far as any of them knew, uttered a single word. Nobody really knew what was wrong with her either. Her usually neat mousy hair was very untidy and there were bits of twig and leaf in it, but otherwise she seemed to be quite unscathed.""***

We know she wasn't physically abused. We just ""don't know"" what happened. No one knows what happened to her it implies something did but the kids just can't put there finger on it. Things like this can be implied in ""kids"" stories but at this point harry potter was becoming more darker and held back more punches. Rowling does this all the time.

I think the theory has some level of merit but it's questionable."

88,1696644149.0,HarryPotterBooks,"Voldy's 6th Horcrux on the day he tried to kill Harry - We all know that approximately by the point Tom Riddle has heard the half-prophecy from Snape, he's made 5 outta 6 Horcruxes he intended to make - the Diary, the Ring, the Diadem? and finally the Locket and the Cup.

Dumbledore theorized he had intended to make another Horcrux using Harry's death which seemed to be a significant death he could use for a Horcrux. We can also theorize he'd probably really really liked for it be have been a Godric's Relic which we now know is his sword but he never found any.

In any case, from Tom's perspective, he never intended to split a part of the soul and stuff it in 1 year old Harry but it happened which Dumbledore says is because his maimed soul was unstable at this point. Which seems to be the case as all recollections (from Harry and Tom) of the day is only about killing James and Lily with the AK and firing the same curse at Harry. No other Horcrux creating incantation or pulling out an object, etc.

He finally creates in his view his 6th but actually 7th Horcrux in Nagini in GoF by killing Frank Bryce? This is what Dumbledore theorized but the Priori Incantatem in GoF didn't vomit out any Horcrux creating magic. So I'm unsure if it's spell and wand kinda magic or just willpower to push the fractured soul into an object kinda mechanic that creates an Horcrux.

Something I always wonder is if he'd actually intended to make a 6th Horcrux on Harry's death? If so, had he conceded that he couldn't find a Godric Relic? If so, what object had he chosen? Why didn't he bring it to Godric's Hollow and he had the object out when he tried to kill Harry? Because knowing him, it sounds like a perfect murder to create his final 6th Horcrux (his 7th but of the 7 part soul dream) by killing a prophecized rival? Did he have an object on him which he'd wanted to be the 6th Horcrux? Which clattered out and is somewhere in the wreck of James and Lily's house? Or did his desire for having a Godric Relic been really so great that he'd pushed the idea of creating his final Horcrux further into the future already when he arrived at Godric's Hollow?

What do you guys think? And another question that popped up when I was writing this was the Priori Incantatem thingy and why the Horcrux creating magic didn't come out as other magic did like Wormtail's silver hand."

However we know how much he cares for Harry so I think he would a lot of sadness at all the pain Harry is experiencing and guilt as well because as much as he wants to protect Harry he knows things won’t get easier.

Sirius admit’s that they all saw him as weak and talentless. 

And the worst part is Peter is arguably the most capable death eater (i have a post on that loaded up in my drafts) so as a talented wizard constantly belittled by the people who treat you like they’re doing you a favor talking to you, it makes perfect sense to join up with a group that treats you with respect, and rewards talent.

When he confronts Dumbledore, he says that Snape made a terrible mistake because he didn't know which boy / family will Voldemort choose to go after.

I didn't thought about it before but Dumbledore's words sound like Snape's actions concerning the prophecy were considered mistake only because it triggered someone they knew. But what if (for whatever reason) Voldemort decided to go after someone e.g. in Romania they didn't know? It seems to me that Dumbledor's argument about mistake is really bad. I mean, Dumbledore (and Snape) must knew that Voldemort would kill the baby (and his/her family) no matter who it was, so it is dumb to presume that Snape made a mistake only because Voldemort attacked the Potters - either way someone would die and only because Snape regretted that it was Lily doesn't mean he would have same regrets if it would be someone else.

117,1696267863.0,HarryPotterBooks,"Neville was supposed to be part of the trio. - There are several reasons why I think Neville was to have a much bigger presence throughout the series.

&#x200B;

* Nevilles's Herbology skills: Herbology is Neville's best subject. Throughout the series we find situations where knowledge of Herbology might come in handy (SPOILERS, if you haven't read all the books). Devil's Snare in B1, Mandrakes in B2, Whomping Willow in B3, Gillyweed in B4, Devil's Snare again in B5. I think that Neville was supposed to be like Hermione and Ron who each have something that helps Harry in his journey, Hermione- Book knowledge, Ron- Strategies and Wizarding World Knowledge and Neville- Herbology. I think JKR intended to utilise Neville in this way hence giving him Herbology expertise, none of the other characters like Seamus, Parvati get any expertise.

&#x200B;

* In the first Book, Neville is much more involved with the trio. Hermione helps him find his toad during the train journey. While Harry meets with Ron, Hermione has already met with Neville, so this is a great way to introduce the group to the readers. Neville is involved in the fight with Malfoy, he goes to Forbidden Forest with them, he tries to stop them from getting the Stone.

* JKR probably already had some idea of Marauders, group of 4 troublemakers. So it makes sense she would plan for Harry-Neville-Ron-Hermione as the next generation of Marauders. They are all misfits in their own way. Hermione is an annoying know-it-all, Ron has self esteem issues, Neville is too timid and poor in magic. But they could work as a group helping each-other.

What do you think?

How would the series change if Neville was there for all their adventures?"

123,1696187530.0,HarryPotterBooks,"Repost - Is Sirius Protected by Love? - I tried to Crosspost, but was unable, so I'm going to repost it, I wanted to know what you thought, as I also prefer the books to the films.

Ok so I'm not sure if this has been discussed but bare with me.

In PoA we learn from Mr Weasley and Fudge that Sirius isn't affected by the Demeter's the way others are, that he's manage to keep most of his mind.

We also learn from Sirius himself that the reason he never lost his mind is because he knew he was innocent and though it wasn’t a happy thought the Dementors couldn’t suck it out of him which kept him sane and in control of his magic.

We also know that when it came too much he'd transform into the dog because Dementors can’t see, you know they see through sensing people's emotions. But what if it wasn't just that...

Dumbledore always mentions the power of Love and Harry's ability to also love telling Harry that this is how he'll defeat Voldemort.

So couldn't Sirius also be protected be love, he loved James and Lily, the brother and sister he never had, he adored and loved Harry would do literally anything for him, so couldn't that also be used as a protection.

Sirius knows Harry will needed him, he's the only one who knows Peter is alive, that overwhelming Love for Harry keeps him safe without him releasing it. And so when his worst dreams become reality he's ready to escape to protect Harry in the way he failed with James.

What are your thoughts?

PS: To those people who keep telling me that Sirius didn't know that Wormtail was still alive here is a direct quote from Chapter 19 if PoA.

PoA - Chapter 19 - The Servant of Lord Voldemort

>‘My God ,’ said Lupin softly, staring from Scabbers to the picture in the paper and back again. ‘His front paw …’‘What about it?’ said Ron defiantly. ‘He’s got a toe missing,’ said Black. ‘Of course,’ Lupin breathed, ‘so simple …so brilliant … He cut it off himself?’‘Just before he transformed ,’ said Black. ‘When I cornered him, he yelled for the whole street to hear that I’d betrayed Lily and James. Then, before I could curse him, he blew apart the street with the wand behind his back, killed everyone within twenty feet of himself – and sped down into the sewer with the other rats …’

He knows Wormtails alive he just doesn't know where."
124,1696169121.0,HarryPotterBooks,"All four named house-elves in the series were abused - Hermione was unquestionably correct to demand their immediate freedom and rights - 
> *“Hermione — open your ears,” said Ron loudly. “They. Like. It. They like being enslaved!”*

Even if this were true for all elves (it’s not), and even if this was a good justification for slavery (it’s not), such a notion would only make sense if elves were generally treated fairly within their servitude. But they are not. Slavery is of course fundamentally unfair, but Dobby, Winky, Kreacher, and Hokey are all abused in ways that go beyond the ""typical"" master-servant relationship. 

Take working animals. Humans will work some dogs and horses extremely hard, but it is still considered cruel to beat them. It is still considered cruel to starve an animal, or to keep it in horrid conditions, even if there is ownership, even if you plan to later kill and eat it! 

What Ron is talking about is that many elves genuinely enjoy serving their wizard masters. Which is true, seemingly. They take pride in it. What they absolutely don't enjoy though, is being abused. Dobby admits upon meeting Harry that his family punishes him excessively:

> *“But won’t they notice if you shut your ears in the oven door?”* 

> *“Dobby doubts it, sir. Dobby is always having to punish himself for something, sir. They lets Dobby get on with it, sir. Sometimes they reminds me to do extra punishments. . . .”*

Winky is made to sit in a high Quidditch box, terrified of heights, with a dangerous criminal under her care, held by an Imperius Curse that's wearing off. When things go wrong that night, she is treated with little dignity:

> *“What’s going to happen to Winky?” said Hermione, the moment they had left the clearing.* 

> *“I don’t know,” said Mr. Weasley.* 

> *“The way they were treating her!” said Hermione furiously. “Mr. Diggory, calling her ‘elf’ all the time . . . and Mr. Crouch! He knows she didn’t do it and he’s still going to sack her! He didn’t care how frightened she’d been, or how upset she was — it was like she wasn’t even human!”*

Ron is quick to point out that Winky is not human (to Hermione's anger), but she is still being treated inhumanely. 

As for Kreacher, Sirius was not known for being particularly gentle:

> *At which Sirius, ignoring Hermione’s protests, seized Kreacher by the back of his loincloth and threw him bodily from the room.*

Hokey was the house-elf of Hepzibah Smith, a rich witch murdered for her heirlooms by Voldemort. Hokey was abused, not by her master, but by the Ministry:

> *“Hepzibah Smith died two days after that little scene,” said Dumbledore, resuming his seat and indicating that Harry should do the same. “Hokey the house-elf was convicted by the Ministry of poisoning her mistress’s evening cocoa by accident.”*

She was convicted of poisoning her mistress... by accident? Case closed, I guess. Like with Winky, wizarding law enforcement was far too quick to assign blame to a poor elf:

> *“Voldemort modified her memory, just like he did with Morfin!”*

> *“Yes, that is my conclusion too,” said Dumbledore. “And, just as with Morfin, the Ministry was predisposed to suspect Hokey —”*

> *“— because she was a house-elf,” said Harry. He had rarely felt more in sympathy with the society Hermione had set up, S.P.E.W.*

It's one thing to observe, as Ron does, that house-elves generally enjoy serving. Even if that were true, the system that enslaves them is ripe for abuse, as evidenced by, well, every elf character not employed by Dumbledore. Like a wizard [John Brown](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Brown%27s_raid_on_Harpers_Ferry), Hermione sees this mistreatment straight away as an obvious evil, and works to defeat it militantly. She organizes. She recruits. She works to free elves in every way she can, even as a young student."

130,1696025963.0,HarryPotterBooks,"I think Rowling made up apparition as she went along in each book - I mean, half the time, it makes a loud popping noise that Harry even recognizes as the exact sound of someone disapparating (OotP), and half the time it’s completely silent. You could argue “it depends on the skill of the character” since Dumbledore is (usually, but not always), but then I would think the sounds would go up or down in volume of the pop based on their skill, not either loud or silent. So it kind of has a set sound, but not really. 

Also splinching wasn’t anything real, nothing but comical until Ron started losing body parts and the seriousness of that, weakening him. Otherwise any time people splinched themselves in the middle of the road and had to wait for ministry wizards to come get them, they’d have massive blood loss before anyone got there lol. People wouldn’t just flinch at it and explain the only problem is “they can’t move either way, they’re stuck”. When Susan Bones apparated and left her leg behind, she wouldn’t just be scared, she’d be screaming with blood gushing out of her leg. 

Edit splinching clarity: so I forgot it was always painful. My point was that it wasn’t medical, potentially deadly. If it were, transporting your top half and leaving your bottom half behind would have you bleed out dead almost instantaneously. The fact that they used “stuck” “waiting” for the wizards to come “sort it out” implies they kinda hung out, even if in pain. But not the deadly thing it turns into. 

I’m not even going to go into side-along-apparation that came into existence so Dumbledore could bring Harry, and Harry could bring Dumbledore back when he was weakened. Or the head-in-fire apparition which always irritates me because if it hadn’t been made up and they just stuck to regular apparition, Harry would’ve found Sirius in the house and not relied on Kreacher to lie to him. 

I guess I did go into it a little… lol only because Sirius is one of my favorite characters and it’s an insult to his character that he’s really only in 2 out of 7 books, but supposedly a main character still somehow, and he died way too soon. So I especially hate that head apparition thing. But basically, I think it’s one of the most inconsistent pieces of magic, as far as basic, supposedly simple pieces of magic go. I genuinely did only start writing this with the intent of talking about the noise thing. The rest just came out.

Edit edit: I mixed up the fire head as apparition when it’s floo powder. My mistake. I was writing the annoyances of the instant transportation inconsistencies, and my Sirius-loving brain went right to the fire head floo powder plot device that stopped Harry from being able to full floo and go into the house and find Sirius and prevent him from dying!!"

133,1695961332.0,HarryPotterBooks,"Should Dudley have been a Squib? - I can’t decide if it is a missed opportunity or if it’s a better story without it. 

It would have been an interesting dynamic, but it would change the nature of squibs. As it is, you to have a wizard parent to be a squib, but it is not just a description of heritage. Squibs might be able to use magic things (not totally clear how much this is just that a say a secrecy scanner could be used by anyone), but they can get around the magic that keeps out true muggles, and see magical things invisible to muggles (poltergeists, dementors, ghosts, etc), it seems they just can’t produce their own magic. 

So comparatively it is like when you a have a phenotype that is controlled by multiple genes, and squib is just when the part of what makes a wizard connect to magic exists, but not the part that has its own magic. I could see a version of HP where they pop up and sometimes muggles think the squib is a psychic or medium since they can see spirits, or people normally realize they are squibs because they live around muggles with the wizarding world hidden to them. 

I could even (albeit something of a stretch) see a scene where Vernon is losing it at petunia after finding out Dudley was “different” only for the scene to somehow reveal Vernon is a squib too. Though the shock of that might just kill him 😅

Edit: TL;DR: Pottermore says Squibs are more than just muggles born to Wizards.

Wow, didn’t realize there was such a division on the perceptions concerning if Mrs. Figg was lying about the ability to see Dementors. To me, the fact that she couldn’t cast a patronus kept her from helping, but she knew what was going on. When Potter tried to hide his wand, she said don’t and that “they”could come back. That seems to me that she saw them. I can guess that others think she assumed there were dementors because she felt them and knew enough about patroni to guess what happened, and then lied to make the case stronger during the hearing. I find it less likely, as I don’t think Albus would risk the only witness lying and then being exposed. I can’t find the author, but there is this article “[Everything You Need To About Squibs](https://www.wizardingworld.com/features/everything-you-need-to-know-about-squibs)” originally on Pottermore; it says they can see spirits but it reads like something not written by JKR, so I can’t count it as primary canon."

136,1695914727.0,HarryPotterBooks,"Snape wasn’t a bad teacher - There is this idea that Snape is a bad teacher, but I don’t think this is the case. I think the thing that people often Miss about snape and his lessons is that tons of students do well in his classes, Harry just does not learn the way Snape teaches.

We can see throughout the books that Snape teaches from a point of necessity, because that is how he has always learned. Prime example would be Occlumency lessons- he has personal experience with Voldemort’s mind reading abilities and he almost surely used the fear of not only Voldemort but of his peers as a student or perhaps his mother to forge this mental skill. Snips entire life has been a big, strong or be crushed ordeal and so that is how he teaches because that is how he learned.

People always hate on him threatening to feed Trevor the frog a potion Neville made, and there is a solid chance. This is something that would have happened to him as a student either from one of his peers, or even his mother. We see that sleep seemed to know how to do plenty of magic before getting to Hogwarts and I suspect this is because his mother forced him to learn. 

Sleep went it’s far is to invent his own spells- doing so because he was being bullied by the marauders. This is high levels of magic performed out of necessity. 

Basically everything Snape knows how to do. He knows how to do very well, because the results when he was younger, we’re either humiliation pain or death, if you did not succeed. He re-create these feelings in the classroom for the students because to him that is the best way to learn. Ironically we see Hermione learn very much the same way and she does very well in potions under him, despite his attitude towards her."

However, the way they are spoken about throughout POA makes it sound like the dementors have the intelligence to know which people they are supposed to be targeting.

When Bellatrix says *“But Master — he is here — he is below -”*, she is clearly referring to Dumbledore alone. He needs not be named. They are in the Ministry of Magic, could it be the Minister, or a top Auror? No, it’s *him*. In other words, you know who, Master. 

It’s no coincidence that this chapter is called *The Only One He Ever Feared*. To the Death Eaters, Dumbledore is as singular a threat as Voldemort is to everyone else. Even the [Mary GrandPré chapter art](https://imgur.com/a/caJFPkz) frames Dumbledore as Voldemort’s visual and magical counterpart. 

Albus does not demand obsequious reverence for his name, but the very sound of it causes some unquiet in the graveyard during Harry’s fourth year: 

> *“And I answer myself, perhaps they believed a still greater power could exist, one that could vanquish even Lord Voldemort . . . perhaps they now pay allegiance to another . . . perhaps that champion of commoners, of Mudbloods and Muggles, Albus Dumbledore?”*

> *At the mention of Dumbledore’s name, the members of the circle stirred, and some muttered and shook their heads. Voldemort ignored them.*

Relative to his servants, Voldemort’s indifference to Dumbledore’s spoken name mirrors Dumbledore’s unconcern at saying Voldemort’s name. This passage is the first mention of Voldemort in the series:

> *“As I say, even if You-Know-Who has gone —”*

> *“My dear Professor, surely a sensible person like yourself can call him by his name? All this ‘You-Know-Who’ nonsense — for eleven years I have been trying to persuade people to call him by his proper name: Voldemort.” Professor McGonagall flinched, but Dumbledore, who was unsticking two lemon drops, seemed not to notice.*

McGonagall and the Death Eaters stir and flinch, but Dumbledore and Voldemort are dismissive of the other because of their own confidence and abilities. I love how they are posed as an unstoppable force, unmovable object dynamic."

152,1695733394.0,HarryPotterBooks,"Does anyone else think the real reason Dumbledore ignored Harry in his fifth year was because of guilt? - Even though he didn't know for certain he highly suspected that Voldemort used Horcruxes and that Harry was likely to be one so upon Voldemorts return he believed it highly likely that Harry had to die soon. He knew Voldemort would return at some point but when he did it suddenly became real to him, perhaps he expected Voldemorts return to happen when Harry was an older man who was already fully prepared to die years in advance of the moment, knowing it was to happen soon may have been Dumbledores actual motivator for distancing himself from Harry because being around him made it too personal for him.

 Dumbledores explanation for distancing himself from Harry doesn't make sense to me, if he wanted to give Voldemort the impression that he wasn't close with Harry that could easily be contradicted by Lucius Malfoy or Peter Petigrew(I won't mention mention Snape because it would make sense for him to withhold that information.) 

In fact I consider it unlikely Voldemort didn't know. Plus if it was a proximity thing Dumbledore could have just openly told Harry from the beginning why he was avoiding him but he didn't. He said he wanted to give Voldemort the impression that they weren't close so Harry wouldn't spy on him even though from Voldemorts perspective he already has a spy? A spy who he correctly believes Dumbledore divulges more information to than he ever would to Harry so I don't buy it."
153,1695727072.0,HarryPotterBooks,"Does anyone else consider themselves not a Fantasy Genre fan but a big Harry Potter fan - I'm a pretty big reader but generally speaking I struggle with fantasy. I prefer more contemporary or historical fiction. I think, amongst many things, the reason I love HP is that there is a tremendous logic to it. JK was so obsessed that there was a plethora of notes that were never included in the book; things like full student lists, the entire story of Mcgonagall, uses for various potions, spells etc. All the departments. Her intigration of historical folklore. It felt like the world had a plausibility to exist. Most fantasy is set in a completely different world where things are made to fit the narrative.

154,1695725875.0,HarryPotterBooks,"What do you think about the Quidditch sequences? - From a writing analysis point, what do you all think of those parts of the books? I remember them being my favorite parts, even if they were maybe like a chapter or slightly more worth of happenings in the early books, and steadily got phased out as they went out (Rowling doesn't like writing sports and it shows), but being that as a kid they were what I liked the most there must have been some merit.

What do you all think they did well? What could have been improved upon?

I do think that a big thing that helped was not only did it have Harry's own direct narration from a position that isn't terribly involved in the direct play (a seeker watches and seeks out a ball while the game plays out around them after all) while also hearing Lee Jordan's commentary sort of helps parse out key information while allowing us to have a sense of how the game is playing out.

On the other hand, I do think that Harry's indirect (and simplistic) position makes it hard for us to appreciate what good or bad Quidditch play is meant to look at, barring the occasional expositional mention from a character who talks about what a position seeks out, and what's good for x y and z."

Rowling takes enough ink to mention the scores of those other matches, but I can't recall a time that any of the books mention Harry watched from the stands. Wouldn't he be interested in watching his competition? Even if he didn't want to for some reason, it feels like Oliver Wood would have dragged the whole team to the other matches. What are your thoughts?

ETA: Comparing this to the old ""we also don't see Harry go to the bathroom"" standby doesn't really hold up. Multiple times, Harry mentions that Quidditch is his favorite thing, or that it's the thing he misses most about Hogwarts (CoS, PoA, GoF). Not once are we told that he loves going to the bathroom. 

With as much color and detail as Rowling *does* give the reader, I simply think it's odd that it's not mentioned once in 5 books (no Quidditch in GoF or DH, obviously) that Harry attended a game. For someone who *loves* Quidditch so much, we hear more about his various homework assignments and Uncle Vernon's old socks than we do about him attending the Quidditch matches of the other houses. There's certainly no need for a detailed description of any of these games; my point stands that it's odd that Harry is never said to have attended the games of any other houses."

170,1695487814.0,HarryPotterBooks,"""James Potter wasn't a bully because Snape gave as good as he got"" - The relationship Snape had with James is a hotly debated topic in this fandom. With the Marauders fandom exploding in popularity, especially on sites like TikTok or Tumblr, a lot of new fans argue that James Potter was never truly a bully or that Snape and James had a balanced rivalry where ""Snape gave as good as he got"". But how accurate are such claims, really? Let's dive into it.

# ""James wasn't a bully""

There is evidence suggesting that the author herself views James as having been a bully. In this [canon Wizarding World article](https://www.wizardingworld.com/writing-by-jk-rowling/remus-lupin) Rowling wrote about Remus Lupin, she says this:  


>Remus functioned as the conscience of this group, but it was an occasionally faulty conscience. He did not approve of their **relentless bullying of Severus Snape**, but he loved James and Sirius so much... that he did not always stand up to them as much as he knew he should.

In the author's own words, James didn't just bully Snape, he did so **relentlessly**. This also directly refutes the argument that, ""well, we only saw ONE scene of James assaulting Snape so there's no proof that James ever attacked him outside of that!"" Nope - it was a prolonged, continuous, ""relentless"" relationship of abuse and victimization.

Furthermore, there is evidence of James bullying (and using illegal Dark Magic on) people other than Snape who also have zero affiliation with Death Eater ideology. The argument that James only ever went after racists or was acting with the noble intention to stand up for minorities when he did stuff like strip Snape naked doesn't hold up.

But if we refuse to accept the author literally spelling things out to us, we can also look at metatextual and literary clues to learn more about Snape and James's relationship in the scene we get together of them. This is how the bullying scene opens:

>“I’m bored,” said Sirius. “Wish it was full moon.” \[...\]  
>  
>“**This’ll liven you up**, Padfoot,” said James quietly. “Look who it is...”  
>  
>Sirius’s head turned. He had become very still, **like a dog that has scented a rabbit**.  
>  
>“Excellent,” he said softly. “Snivellus.”

As u/pet_genius said in one of their amazing posts, Sirius and James are motivated by boredom (not justice). Snape is compared to prey, to be hunted and brutalized, while a Marauder is compared to a predator. This doesn't connote a 1 to 1 rivalry but rather a relationship of bullying and victimization. As the scene continues:

>Lupin was still staring down at his book, though **his eyes were not moving and a faint frown line had appeared between his eyebrows**. Wormtail was looking from Sirius and James to Snape with a look of **avid anticipation on his face**. \[...\]  
>  
>“All right, Snivellus?” said James loudly.  
>  
>Snape reacted so fast it was **as though he had been expecting an attack.** \[...\]  
>  
>Wormtail was on his feet now, **watching hungrily**, **edging around Lupin** to get a clearer view.  


All of this implies that this is a regular occurrence, NOT a one-off. In other words, the Marauders have committed many similar attacks on Snape in the past, to the point where Wormtail is able to excitedly anticipate exactly how things are about to play out. The Marauders also have zero fear of Snape, and eagerly look forward to opportunities to attack him, showing that he wasn't viewed as a respected adversary on equal terms with them (""muh 1v1 rivalry"") but rather as a weaker target to bully and victimize.

# ""Snape gave as good as he got""

The line that Snape ""gave as good as he got"" is constantly spread by certain fans who repeat it word-for-word and even put it in quotation marks as if it were something legitimately said by a character in the series. But in reality, **the words ""gave as good as he got""** ***never appear in any of the seven books*****,** nor in anything the author has written. **It's literally a fake quote** made up to justify the assault and victimization of child Snape. Seriously. 

What *does* appear is a conversation Harry has in Book 5 with Lupin and Sirius that people use to accuse Snape of having harassed, assaulted, and attacked James just as badly as he was. What Lupin says is that Snape ""never lost an opportunity to curse James"". However, that doesn't automatically negate the fact that James relentlessly bullied Snape and countless other innocent students, abusing his social status and power to torment others. It's also important to recognize the full context of the conversation:

>“\[Lily\] started going out with \[James\] **in seventh year**,” said Lupin.  
>  
>""**Once James had deflated his head** a bit,” said Sirius.  
>  
>""**And stopped hexing people** just for the fun of it,” said Lupin.  
>  
>“Even Snape?” said Harry.  
>  
>Well,” said Lupin slowly, “Snape was a **special case**. I mean, he never lost an opportunity to curse James, so you couldn’t really expect James to take that lying down, could you?”

It's unclear what time period Lupin refers to when he accuses Snape of taking every chance he can to curse James. It's possible that he's accusing Snape of cursing James throughout all seven years of being at Hogwarts, but it's equally (if not more) likely that he's only talking about Snape in seventh year, given the context of the conversation.

**When Lupin makes his accusation, he and Harry are talking about the person James became** ***in seventh year***. He's talking about the version of James that no longer found it funny to hex random victims; the version of James that got to begin dating Lily. In fact, all five sentences spoken right before Lupin claims Snape cursed James exclusively describe events that happened in seventh year. And if Snape only began initiating fights with James in his very last year at Hogwarts, that doesn't make their relationship one of ""mutual bullying"" or erase the previous 6 years of abuse he endured. Ultimately, **the conversation is ambiguous** and cannot be used as undeniable proof that Snape ""gave as good as he got"" throughout his entire time at school.

Furthermore, regardless of outcome, there's zero reason to take the interaction as gospel because Lupin and Sirius are not unbiased narrators - in fact, they were literally James's co-bullies and/or enablers. Lupin is financially indebted to James, owing his life to him, and has previously given Harry misinformation and misled him about the Snape-James relationship. And even into his 30s, Sirius doesn't regret his ""prank"" where he tried to murder Snape by using his marginalized friend as a weapon to kill his bullying victim. **There is no conclusive evidence proving that Snape ""gave as good as he got"" to James.**

# ""Snape's memories of bullying are biased""

While I don't doubt that Snape himself is biased, that's simply not how Pensieve memories work. [The author has confirmed in an interview](https://www.the-leaky-cauldron.org/2007/07/28/jkrhbp3/) that Pensieve memories are not affected the views or opinions of the person they belong to and reflect objective reality:

>Q: Do the memories stored in a Pensieve reflect reality or the views of the person they belong to?  
>  
>A: **It's reality.** It's important that I have got that across \[...\] **Otherwise it really would just be like a diary, wouldn't it?**

The scene from Snape's Worst Memory in Book 5 happened exactly as it played out on page. We really did see James attack Snape unprovoked, simply because his friend was bored. We really did see James gleefully engage in one of the worst bullying scenes in the entire series. It's not up for debate. Obviously, Snape wasn't an angel, and he did plenty of bad shit too, but you shouldn't have to be a perfect paragon of morality for your victimhood to be acknowledged.

171,1695461028.0,HarryPotterBooks,"Werewolfes and Animagi - Just a silly idea that's been running through my head:
We know that being an Animagus is not innate, but can be learned.
James, Sirius manage this during school time and without outside help, and the less talented Peter only needs the help of 2 classmates, but not that of a teacher or adult.

But what happens when a werewolf becomes an Animagus? OK, his animal form would certainly be that of a wolf. But would the voluntary wolf form be as unpredictable as the involuntary one at full moon? Or would the wizard retain control as Sirius did in his dog form?

This then leads to the next question:
What happens at the full moon if the wizard transforms into his Animagus wolf in time beforehand?

Does the good wolf then turn into a bad wolf?

It is written that werewolves do not attack animals, and that wizards are also protected in their animagi. That's why James, Sirius and Peter learn this ability. 

So being in the Animagus form offers some protection.
And even if not, at least the wizard saves himself the painful transformation? The transformation into the Animagus form seems to be painless, while the transformation from a human into a wolf is extremely painful for werewolves.

What do you say: Could Lupin have saved himself a lot of trouble, or at least pain, if he also would have learned to be an Animagus together with his friends?"

Thats right the blast ended skrewts. 

An animal that the others couldn't even know existed and would see for the first time, could make them stuck for a good while.
While hogwarts students who studied them for that year would actually have an idea on how to get around it right when they see them.

184,1695253396.0,HarryPotterBooks,"How Close Was Voldemort to Winning the First War? - Most evidence seems to suggest that if he really wanted to be Minister of Magic he could get the job through the democratic process; or at minimum gain enough power to launch a coup.

Instead he and his followers launch a defacto insurgency; murdering ethnic minorities and anybody who doesn't support his rise to power. If he had enough strength one one would reasonably assume that he could just storm the ministry of magic and end the war in one fell swoop. Or at minimum that there would be battles instead of skirmishes.

But what exactly counts as a victory? The Ministry has their back against the wall; they're going to fight until the bitter end; the only way I can see this working is just gradually killing enough tax paying citizens or Ministry workers that they dont have the ability to hold off his army anymore.

The year before that would not be much better. The tournament would clash with the opening of the Chamber of Secrets.

Question is: why is that? Is it because the diary was the first horcrux? 

I’m thinking if you split a 100% soul in half, you have 50%. So, is the next horcrux only going to be 25% - then 12.5% for the next one - and so on?

-OR- does the original soul expand after being split, so it’s closer to 50% each time? *(seems unlikely in Voldemort’s case, but then we see the soul in the diary expand)*

-OR- are the capabilities of the horcrux determined by the nature of the object? *(for example, the diary is capable of thought and communication, because it’s a tool used for thought & communication? The locket is an object of vanity, and it attacks Ron’s vanity when facing destruction)*

BONUS question: do the soul pieces in the horcruxes grow & expand, depending on what the object experiences? *(Like we see happening to the journal as it grows in power once it interacts with Ginny ~ and how objects like the teacup that are always locked away seem to have less influence & power?)*"

Immediately I thought about the second book, where it is made clear that Lucius Malfoy tries to give Harry the diary, wich we find out later is a horcrux, in attempts to bring his master back to power. Not only that, also in The Goblet of Fire, Voldemort expresses his disappointment towards Malfoy regarding the lack of effort on tracking him down or helping him rise again. What happened?

202,1694960480.0,HarryPotterBooks,"The Villain Conundrum - I wanted to share some thoughts I posted in a reply the other day to the main HP subreddit in response to   a post in which the user stated they found Voldemort underwhelming as a villain. That they didn't understand the threat he posed and found other villains in the stories more compelling. Of course, this user had only seen the movies.

Now, don't get me wrong. I find the other villains in Harry Potter very compelling. I think many are more relatable to people's experiences, especially Umbridge, and they seem like the real evil in these stories. It's understandable, but I think it also misses the larger point that is being made.

There is a gross misunderstanding of what Voldemort represents and who he is amongst this community(meaning the HP fandom as a whole, the HP books community seems much more in touch with the lessons of the books), and that scares me because the message he is meant to convey is more important now than ever.

Riddle/Voldemort himself is a cruel, selfish, power-hungry man who doesn't understand and is seemingly incapable of love. He isn't driven by money or greed, only power. He wants to be known as the most powerful Wizard in history. He wants to go further and delve farther into dark magic than anyone before him. He wants to be feared and have total control over those around him.

He also fears his own mortality and spends a lot of his energy on finding ways to cheat death.

But what people don't understand is that all of this isn't what makes him the ultimate villain in the series. *It's the fact that he uses his power to embolden the very worst elements and aspects of the Wizarding World.*

It's not like evil didn't exist without Voldemort. We know there was rampant racism, classism, corruption, and greed in the Wizarding World, just like in ours. But like in our world, a lot of that usually remains veiled under the guise of civilization. Racists talk in murmurs, class status is simply understood and not spoken of, corruption is in the shadows, and greed is disguised as success. 

But what leaders like Voldemort do is bring all of the worst parts of our societies out into the open and normalize them, even encourage that behavior.  To weaponize government and media, and use terror and fear to recruit or quell resistance.  They twist truth and reality to confuse right from wrong, and anything said against them is decried as a lie or as them being unfairly persecuted. Those who act or campaign against them are villainized and made out to be all the bad things that Voldemort or other leaders actually are. In other words, projection.

Having Voldemort in power *creates* all those antagonists people in this community claim are more compelling than Voldemort. *They can't exist or act openly without the tacit approval of Voldemort's strength and power behind them. They are emboldened by his support and do not fear reciprocity. He gives them a Hall Pass of sorts to pursue their darkest desires, which in a lawful, civilized society would be frowned upon and punished. In Voldemort's world, it's celebrated.*

Without Voldemort, Wormtail just remains kind of a wimpy guy who counts on the protection and aid of his stronger, more talented friends. Without Voldemort, Barty Crouch Jr might have been able to break out of the perceived hold his father had over him and used his remarkable talents to benefit society. Without Voldemort Lucius Malfoy is still rich but has to keep his racist tendencies and cruelty to himself. Without Voldemort Delores Umbridge is still an awful woman, but she has checks and balances on her ambitions and power and has to keep that side in the dark so as not to lose her position. Without Voldemort Bellatrix is just a criminal, or may not have even become one knowing her family's wealth. She may have just been another Malfoy, abusing those who she has power over and espousing her darkest thoughts behind closed doors. Without Voldemort Greyback is still a threat but has the full force of the Ministry against him and has to keep his bloodlust under control. Without Voldemort Fudge is less likely to be able to abuse his power and engage in open corruption, as he wouldn't have the threat of Voldemort as an excuse for it.

All of this is what Voldemort symbolizes. A leader so powerful and that people are so drawn to that he enables and empowers the worst aspects of their character and brings them out into the open. All of this should sound frighteningly familiar to our world as it is today. People all but openly worshipping powerful men who encourage their racism, homophobia, xenophobia, and hate. Men who embolden the rich and powerful to abuse their status and position while riling up the poor to lash out at those different than them or that he claims are persecuting them.

All this should sound familiar, and all this should make it clear why Voldemort is such a terrifying villain."

211,1694811547.0,HarryPotterBooks,"Media and Journalism in the Wizarding World? - So, I've recently come to a realization about the Harry Potter series, specifically in the context of professional journalism portrayed within the books (not the movies). It got me thinking about the underlying themes, and I wanted to share my thoughts with you all.

It seems to me that the way journalism is depicted in the books reflects a broader theme of distrusting established power structures. In the Wizarding World, it's clear that mainstream media is often portrayed in a negative light, while grassroots efforts hold more value.

Let me break it down a bit:

First off, we have the whole issue of fake news and propaganda in the Daily Prophet, with Rita Skeeter personifying yellow journalism. On one hand, she does expose some troubling situations, like Dumbledore keeping secrets or the incidents in the Chamber of Secrets. However, she also fuels the magical community's prejudice against characters like Hagrid and Hermione in Goblet of Fire, often resorting to unethical means (remember her note for Bathilda Bagshot on that copy of her book in Deathly Hallows?).

The Daily Prophet itself becomes a mouthpiece for various administrations, from Cornelius Fudge to Rufus Scrimgeour and even Voldemort's regime, highlighting how established media can be manipulated and censored.

But the negative portrayal of journalism isn't just about Rita. Even before she enters the picture, there are instances like Gilderoy Lockhart's media spectacle at Flourish & Blotts, with the overenthusiastic Prophet photographer annoying everyone around – literally stepping on Ron’s foot.

And let's not forget that Hagrid himself warns Harry in Philosopher's Stone that the Prophet might not always get its facts straight. (I think).

Now, it's important to note that not all journalism in the Wizarding World is painted with the same brush. For example, the Radio Network “Wizarding Wireless Network” (W.W.N.) is mentioned a few times. I get the impression that this network is more geared towards entertainment, perhaps even ""infotainment,"" rather than serious journalism. However, it's worth mentioning that this media is not depicted negatively either, further underscoring the theme of skepticism towards established sources of news and information in the magical realm.

Finally, there are two grassroots projects that stand out:

•	Xeno Lovegood's ""The Quibbler,"" initially seen as a trashy magazine, turns out to be one of the last sources of truth in Deathly Hallows. Yet, Xeno’s resistance breaks, after the deatheaters capture Luna and keep her hostage, so the magazine gives up on the political fight.

•	Following the Quibbler's transformation, we have ""Potterwatch,"" a radio project hosted by Lee Jordan, which aims to provide information to everyone in the resistance.

So, what do you all think about this portrayal of journalism in the Harry Potter series? Do you see it as a commentary on the importance of independent and grassroots media in challenging established power structures within the Wizarding World?"

213,1694777158.0,HarryPotterBooks,"Why Order of the Phoenix is my favourite - Goblet of Fire and Order of the Phoenix are my top two books in the series. But if I had to choose I’m going with the latter. My reasons are:

Visiting different locations such as the Ministry, St Mungos, Grimmauld Place

Being the longest book allows more depth and detail than the others

Umbridge is a villain you hate and she makes the entire school suffer

Dumbledore being absent increases the sense of isolation and desperation

Harry rises as a leader via teaching Dumbledore’s Army

The realism of corruption, coverup and media smear

An accurate depiction of a stressed teenager

Psychologically  based with occlumency

An ominous tone of escalation that isn’t matched

The Dumbledore v Voldemort duel

I wondered though what would've happened if in CoS Ron would've brought Scabbers with him in the flying car when they went to rescue Harry? 

Could Scabbers just have come with them since he didn't want to do harm at that very moment? Or would this cause the Weasleys to not see the house at Privet Drive?

If I told best friend 1 the truth that I hadn't put my own name in the Goblet of Fire and he mistrusted me and abandoned me and I told best friend 2 the same truth that I hadn't put my own name in the Goblet of Fire and she immediately believed me without question, I would know that best friend 1 was a disloyal fair weather friend and would permanently end my friendship with him.

217,1694724914.0,HarryPotterBooks,"Order of the Phoenix vs. Death Eaters: Who Was the More Effective group? - In the wizarding world, the conflict between the Death Eaters and the Order of the Phoenix was central. But when we examine the dynamics within these groups, one striking difference stands out: the level of trust and unwavering loyalty to their respective leaders.

In the Order of the Phoenix, there’s a remarkable sense of trust in Dumbledore. None of its members presume to know better than the venerable wizard. Even when it comes to characters like Sirius Black, known for his rebellious streak, they follow Dumbledore’s guidance without question. The prime example of this trust is Snape. Despite personal animosity towards him, the Order members accept and rely on him because Dumbledore vouched for him.

On the flip side, we see a distinct lack of trust and unity among the Death Eaters. Doubt and suspicion run rampant, as demonstrated when Bellatrix Lestrange confronts Snape in “Half-Blood Prince.” The Death Eaters often question the motives and loyalties of their own members, leading to internal strife and competition.

Maybe Harry specifically requesting not to be put in Slytherin just stopped the hat from having to spend more time coming to a decision and it just defaulted to Gryffindor but it could have easily decided he was a better fit in Gryffindor if made to choose on its own and given the time.

Edit: Just to be clear my reason for saying that the hat was deliberating between Slytherin and Gryffindor is the fact that once the hat verified that Harry was 100% sure he didn't want to be placed in Slytherin he was immediately placed in Gryffindor with no further deliberation by the hat.

Snape was explaining to Harry that Voldy could access the connection in reverse and learn of Harry's thoughts and feelings and use them to lure him into trouble.

Nevermind the trouble which happened anyway, but imagine if Voldy could sense Harry's raging moments in the beginning of the book against literally everyine and Harry's excitement when he kissed Cho and stuff.

241,1694315845.0,HarryPotterBooks,"What did Dudley see when the dementor was about to suck out his soul? - Dudley is a fascinating character in this moment when you think about how he reacts similarly to how Harry does the first time that he came in contact with the dementors. The only difference is that he has no idea what is going on because he can’t see them like Harry could. How terrifying would it be to be attacked by a dementor: you get cold, you get really sad, it gets dark, then it makes you relive your worst memories. Now add that you can’t see it and you have no clue what it is at all. That’s Dudley in this situation

Dudley lived a pretty spoiled life up to that point. His parents treated him like he was the most perfect person on earth, his aunt spoiled him in the few times she’s in contact (gifts, money, etc.), his friends group worshipped him as the leader and helped to beat up on whoever they didn’t agree with. Being forced to relive your worst memories during a dementor attack, what did Dudley see?

I have two guesses:
1. Seeing when he only had 36 presents when last year he had 37 😂 (this a joke)
2. Dudley sees all the times he and the people around him mistreated Harry. His worst memories aren’t necessarily of things happening to himself, but seeing himself at his lowest when bullying the one person he knows has a horrible life. He sees all the times he tormented Harry and all the times he’s treated with extra attention while Harry is neglected. My reason for this is because Dudley didn’t have any idea what a dementor was, therefore he didn’t really understand that Harry saved his life (I know he heard Harry say that he could have had his soul sucked out, but we don’t really know what that means without the background of dementors we get on the books). And from there out, Dudley starts actually being kind to Harry. I know it’s in short snippets because we don’t really get a whole lot of Dudley-Harry interactions after that. But he even gives Harry tea in t OotP, and he also doesn’t want to leave in the DH without Harry I think. (There may be more that I’m blanking on, I’m rereading them now and I’m halfway through OotP, so help me out if you’ve got any others)"

243,1694297772.0,HarryPotterBooks,"How did the Marauders' animagi secret survive the first war? - So, it might have been discussed a million times, or it might have been too tiny a detail to mention it, but it has never occurred to me how weird it is that none of the Death Eaters knew about Sirius being an animagus until reuniting with Peter upon Voldemort's comeback. (Since, according to the talk at Grimmauld Place, it became unsafe for Sirius to get out as a dog, because Peter had just revealed his secret in Death Eater circles.) 

Given how determined Voldemort was to kill James, it was a valuable piece of information for him that James and his best friend were animagi. By mentioning it, Peter could score points with him, and by hiding it, potentially get himself in trouble if it got out another way. I imagine that after Peter changed sides, Voldemort wanted any intel he could that from him. Of course, there was a chance he shared it with V, but it didn't reach any of the DEs, though it would also be strange even for Lucius not to know, since it was the kind of info that could potentially help to catch James (or Sirius and get to James through him). 

I had a thought that maybe Peter wanted to keep it to himself to avoid revealing that he was an animagus, too. It turned out to be a decent escape plan and under different circumstances, he could have used it to escape from Voldemort. Still, with Voldemort's legilimency skills, did he really not know?

Thinking more about it, it's even slightly weird that the Marauders didn't think to reveal it within the Order as a potential advantage that could be factored into the Order's plans. (Admittedly, none of them had a form that was as useful as McGonnagal's, but still.) I know, it was illegal, but I can't see anyone caring under the circumstances. Unless there were always too many questions about who to trust. It seems to be the case but it paints a miserable picture of what the Order was (which still kind of fits, given that it never occurred to anyone who worked with Sirius that he might be innocent). 

It seems that it may be simply a plot contrivance (likely), but it got me thinking about how both sides constantly messed up due to the lack of trust for their own people and poor communication (seemingly in both wars). Also, of the tiny possibility that even Peter stayed stubbornly loyal to a school secret for as long as possible. "

I know some find him annoying but I like that we see him breaking down and we see that he is human and flawed and there is only so much one person can take. That then makes me appreciate him in the final two books even more as after such a painful year he matures and gets better at controlling his anger.

Second book..attacks kept happening despite all the measures he put into motion.He also hired a very incompetent teacher to teach DADA who was willing to put students at risk.
Thrid book..Sirius Black managed to enter Hogwarts despite Dementors guarding.Hell even they managed to enter the grounds!Hiring Hagrid who was an untrained as a teacher was also not an intelligent idea
He let Snape..a staff.. have his bullying ways with Harry and doing absolutely nothing to stop him from doing so
In the sixth book..despite Harry's protests and instead of taking some active measures about it he let things run their course with only Snape unsuccessfully surveilling Draco and letting Death Eaters enter Hogwarts.

With Bill and George’s injuries after the final battle, there was nothing to be done. And Mad Eye Moody has lots of scars and is missing an eye and foot. And everyone who still has to wear glasses or spectacles or bifocals etc.

What about battery powered devices? I ask because Hermione said that electrical devices don’t work at Hogwarts because there’s too much magic in the air.

So I wonder if it would be doable to have a home with muggle and magical elements with a normal family. Like if a muggleborn and muggle were to marry. Like McGonagall’s parents and Seamus’ and Snape’s parents iirc. 

I just find it hard to believe magical society is so ignorant of everything muggle if such marriages aren’t unheard of. Uncommon, perhaps. Like when a married muggleborn takes their spouse and children to their parents for Christmas dinner. Etc.

If it helps, my headcanon is that magic interferes with things that use frequencies like phones, radar, radios. So I’m curious if a muggleborn who marries a muggle can have things their spouse might want like normal kitchen appliances and electric lighting. Or perhaps they would have to go all gas."

Everyone has been telling him thjs but I think when Harry does something in him just snaps. He also just misses Harry terribly and wants to be close to him in any way he can.

I know people see this scene as Sirius viewing Harry as James but I don’t fully agree with that. He is lashing out here and hurting here so I don’t think this scene is a good indicator of how he sees Harry. There are countless other scenes where he does see Harry for who he is. Certainly he misses James and the connection they had and he might look to Harry to fill that but it is very complex as he also knows Harry is his own person and I think he wants to be that godfather that Harry needs but it is very difficult for him to do so when he is in such a bad headspace"

269,1693913328.0,HarryPotterBooks,"The interpretation of the burial of Mad Eye Moody's all seeing eye. - This is the text:

>Early next morning, before the other two were awake, Harry left the tent to search the woods around them for the oldest, most gnarled, and resilient — looking tree he could find. There in its shadow he buried Mad-Eye Moody’s eye and marked the spot by gouging a small cross in the bark with his wand.

It seems unassuming, but there are some strange things going on here. Why do the burial alone, when the others are sleeping? Why so early in the morning. Why does Harry mark the spot with a cross? (Harry doesn't mark Dobby's grave with a cross later in the book).

This is the interpretation I give for this:

This passage is a foreshadowing for Harry facing Voldemort and his own mortality in the Forbidden Forrest later in the book.

The oldest, most gnarled looking tree could symbolize the Elder Wand. It is an elder tree. The all-seeing eye is a symbol of having knowledge of all the perspectives. It is a God symbol, I think. In the chapter King's Cross, Harry finally gains the knowledge of Dumbledore's perspective. Dumbledore has *almost* omniscient knowledge and insight.

He does the burial alone, because he has to face Voldemort alone.

He buries it in the early morning, because he faces and triumphs over Voldemort early in the morning. (It is really love's triumph over death, metaphysically speaking.)

He marks it with a cross as a foreshadowing of King's **Cross**. King's Cross is, shortly stated, the center of Harry's circular story, where the Muggle world and the Magical world meet.

What do you think?

It is also a better final rest place, than Dolores Umbridge's perverse repurposing of the eye as a sort of 'Big Brother Is Watching You'-eye."

No series is perfect, and HP has it's ups and downs but the biggest issue for me is how they handled Wormtail. This is probably a SUPER unpopular opinion but Peter Pettigrew is my favorite villain hands down and potentially my favorite character, and I feel like the story built him as a really big antagonist in the first half of the story. But then...nothing.

I don't get it. In Prisoner of Azkaban, he's revealed as this traitor who was the most responsible for the death of Harry's Parents outside of Voldy, killed 12 people and framed Sirius. Then in year 4 he not only kills Cedric(Which I find odd because everyone, in the story refuses to acknowledge this), but is also the NUMBER 1 reason Voldemort was raised again.

But from that point on he's a minor character. He doesn't appear at all in 5 in the present, he only appears in Snape's mansion at the beginning of 6, and outside of showing up to die he doesn't really do anything in Book 7 either.

What happened? Even though he was a coward he was a huge part of the story and was utterly rotten to the core. So why does J.K. Rowling put him in the backseat in the latter portions of the story?"

280,1693756552.0,HarryPotterBooks,"Sorting Hat Song Styles - To recap: 
Year 1: a jaunty little tune about how the hat is not a basic bitch, along with brief descriptions of house qualities.

Year 4: a little more background on the founders, the virtues they valued. Then about how the hat was enchanted to be able to sort and about how it’s “never yet been wrong.”

Year 5: a continuation about differing values and qualities of the founders/houses. Though now conflict due to differences of the beliefs of the founders, the houses have “never been united as they once were meant to be.” Also with the Hat’s own personal feelings about sorting and dividing students when “warning history shows, for our Hogwarts is in danger from external deadly foes. And we must unite inside her, or we’ll crumble from within.”  

According to Nearly Headless Nick: “The hat feels itself honor-bound to give the school due warning when it detects great danger for the school. Always with the same advice: stand together, be strong from within.” Also since it always stays up in Dumbledore’s office, it “picks things up there.”

With all this being said, I am curious about what the Hat would have sung about in years 2,3,6, and 7. 

Hermione was the only one of the trio to hear the song in the second year. And since she doesn’t say anything to Harry and Ron about what the Hat said, I doubt it was at all “illuminating.” Unless the Hat heard about the Flying Ford Anglia and on the spot did an entirely improvised song about Harry’s and Ron’s adventure. (I do realized of course that this all could just be because of story/plot necessities of the moment.) 

Year 3 would have given the Hat a good reason to tell the school to stand united against “external deadly foes.” Though now I wonder if the hat believed that Sirius Black was innocent and “knew” he couldn’t have done the things he was accused of. After all, Pettigrew was the Gryffindor/Slytherin Hatstall and Sirius broke the tradition of his whole family being in Slytherin. In any case, Ron would most likely not read too much into anything the Hat would talk about besides its role and the descriptions of the houses. 

As for years 6 & 7, the former is basically a repeat of the previous year. Year 7, I can only imagine the Hat doing a full on Broadway extravaganza about the current sign of the times.

Sorry that was a lot more than I thought I was going to write lol."

At the same time I think it is a little different from the first four books as I think even though his respect and loyalty to Dumbledore is very high, he does realise Dumbledore can make mistakes and that he might not always be right- in book 6 he questions Dumbledore about Snape and Malfoy. In book 7 he has to sort of go through this journey again and he questions everything but is eventually able to trust and accept that Dumbledore is human"

""Because of the full moon"" isn't a satisfying answer though. In PoA the characters are in the shrieking shack and then come back to the castle eventually, where Lupin transforms shortly after. But what exactly triggered that? Has the moon just risen? How high does it have to be for him to transform? Does he need to look at it or be touched by the light? The latter two wouldn't make sense Because he could just stay inside and not transform then. 
The movie didn't make sense at all since he just transformed after he SAW the moon that was already high in the sky.

Then later we hear that Filch found extra cleaning supplies in it, Fred and George used it as a hiding space and that Trelawney hid her alcohol bottles there. So how did everyone find this room accidentally, especially Dumbledore who was just going to the toilet? Surely he would have a) known where the bathroom is and b) not have walked by the same place 3 times searching for it 🤔

We know that The Room of Requirement is located on Hogwarts' seventh floor, across from the tapestry of Barnabas the Barmy. And that to ""open it"" you must walk past the area of the door three times, thinking of what you need. So those at every specific instructions. 

So even if Dumbledore was walking down the corridor thinking of toilets, surely he wouldn't walk by the corridor with the tapestry 3 times for no reason... Fred and George, sure may have run by 3 times and Filch could have walked back and forth causes he's a bit odd, and Trelawney was drunk when looking for somewhere to hide her bottles so she could have as well, but I feel like Dumbledore just wouldn't for no reason, unless he knew the room was there?

297,1693572865.0,HarryPotterBooks,"Did Astronomy really need to be a mandatory course? - As we all know, there are seven “core” subjects which all Hogwarts students are required to take during their first five years at the school. They are:

1. Transfiguration: Transforming one object or being into another. 
2. Charms: Enhancing, altering, or adding to the magical properties of an object. 
3. Potions: Brewing magical substances. 
4. Herbology: Studying and handling magical plants, an important element in potion making.
5. History of Magic: Studying significant events in the magical community.   
6. Defence Against the Dark Arts: Learning defensive spells and studying curses and dark creatures. 
7. Astronomy: Observing stars and planets. 

In addition, students are asked to pick up 2-3 elective subjects of their choosing starting in their third year (unless you’re Hermione and have a Time Turner which allows you to take every single elective). The options are:

1. Care of Magical Creatures: Studying and handling magical animals. Known in the scientific community as Magizoology. 
2. Divination: Essentially fortune telling, regardless of what Trelawney claims. 
3. Arithmancy: Studying the magical properties of numbers. 
4. Ancient Runes: Reading and translating magical hieroglyphics. 
5. Muggle Studies: Understanding the non-magical community. 

Call me crazy, but with the exception of Divination I feel like all of those subjects would made more sense as a mandatory credit than Astronomy. That’s not to say that Astronomy wouldn’t be useful or interesting, but it should have been an elective. In my opinion, all Hogwarts students should have been required to take Muggle Studies. Yes, even the muggleborns. They would bring an interesting perspective to the classroom and prevent the lessons from becoming an echo chamber of misinformation. Mind you, parents like Lucius and Narcissa would definitely cause an outrage about it, but in my opinion the benefits would outweigh the risks. Even Arthur, who considers himself something of a muggle expert, couldn’t even count muggle money."

I then decided to try HP and was hoping it would not feel the same although this too is written for teenagers. I saw the movies a long time ago and enjoyed them but by now I can barely remember anything h from them so I wasn't worried it would ruin the books for me. 

I was happy to find out the the writing felt more mature. I think also the 3rd person POV contributed and in general, the story was also interesting enough. I really enjoyed the 1st book and hope the rest are just as good or better.

But the question is, do you wish that the Caractacus Burke scene was an actual memory which Dumbledore and Harry would enter in the Pensieve, land inside the shop and watch Caractacus and Merope exchanging dialogue with what Caractacus said in his misty form and then her selling him the locket?

I really like his inner dialogue when he is coming to terms with Ron being a prefect and just being in his head in book 5 while sometimes difficult to read, it really helps you get a sense of how isolated and frustrated he feels. Sometimes it can also be very funny as well. You also just see how deeply he cares and feels inside.

Then we have the biggest confrontation between them where Harry harshly chides Lupin for wanting to come with them and leave his child behind and while the conversation ends badly, Lupin does go back and later asks Harry to be the child’s godfather.

Then after she experiences one heartbreak, she never again is characterized outside of the scope of her relationship/ lack thereof with Remus (with slight exception in the seven Potters chapter of DH, which I’ll address below). 

I get that heartbreak and depression can happen to anyone, but every move she makes after that point is literally within the context of either unrequited or requited love. Basically everything in HBP, from storming up to the castle when she hears about a werewolf attack, to changing her entire Patronus, to losing her Metamorphmagus abilities. 

In the Seven Potters Chapter, while she does hold her own, the phrasing of it is constantly meant to remind us of her relationship with Remus. Like Ron guiltily looking at him before placing his hands on her waist, Lupin angrily/ worriedly asking why they were late, etc. Tonks compliments Ron’s skills during that battle but we don’t hear anything that Tonks did. 

Then in the end, she rushes off into battle at Hogwarts just to find Remus with absolutely no other concern on her mind, she leaves her baby son with her mom (btw her dad JUST died) and again, the only characterization is her dedication to Remus.

I had assumed that Voldemort was in power for only a few years before his downfall. (If the books explicitly say it, I missed it.) If Molly and Arthur married at a time when Voldemort and his supporters were powerful enough to be wreaking so much havoc that life was uncertain and scary for the average person, how long did it take for his reign to get to that point? Because if Voldemort was at the height of his power when Baby Harry took him down some pegs, He would have to have been in power or rising to it for at least 5 years. (with the thought that Molly and Arthur had eloped years prior and Molly was constantly pregnant/unless they had kids before nuptials) It took basically 1 yr for his second rise to be widely acknowledged (from book 5-6) and for the fear and uncertainty to creep back into people’s lives.

[Decimal Day](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Decimal_Day) took place on February 15, 1971. Before this date, the British pound was made up of 20 shillings, each of which was made up with 12 pence. The shilling was abolished, and the pound was subdivided into 100 “new pence”. Notably, the pre-decimalisation system is somewhat more similar to Wizarding currency – there are three “tiers” or denominations (Galleons>Sickles>Knuts vs Pounds>Shillings>Pence), and the odd conversion rates between the denominations were closer.

Arthur was born in 1950, and probably would have graduated Hogwarts in 1968 or thereabouts. Whatever Muggle Studies O.W.L.s or N.E.W.T.s he would have had to have taken to get his Ministry job would have tested his ability to convert muggle money under the pre-decimalisation system. Right as Mr. Weasley was getting his career underway, suddenly the system of currency he learned in school was completely changed. If you’ve ever had a coworker who had “the old way of doing things” replaced with a new system, you’ve probably seen that it takes a *long* time for them to get used to the new way. Even in his career, Mr. Weasley probably doesn’t have much reason to run into muggle money all that often, so every time he does it’s baffling to him.

But wait! Isn’t Arthur confused even by the numbers on muggle bank notes? Yes, this can be explained by him being unused to paper banknotes. Not only is wizarding currency all in coins, but also muggle bank notes are frequently redesigned to prevent forgeries. The £20 note for example was redesigned in 1970 (again, right after he left school), and again in 1991 (just before meeting Harry for the first time)."

322,1693108383.0,HarryPotterBooks,"What would you prefer as Harry’s career? - Post Deathly Hallows, I can’t decide whether Harry should have been an international Quidditch player or the Defence Against the Dark Arts professor.

He always felt the ‘freedom’ anytime on a broom and he’s young enough to be an international star, whereas on the other hand, he loved the DA enough to be the only thing pulling him back to Hogwarts in book 5. AND becoming the DADA teacher post book 7 would make him such an antithesis to Voldemort who got denied the same job and eventually put a hex on it.

How cool would it be if Harry did what Voldemort couldn’t, and became a long term DADA at 18?!

On the other hand he definitely has the skill to become an international Quidditch player and ideally you wanna enter into sports early enough in your career.

So I can’t decide what he should’ve done post Hogwarts (definitely not an Auror considering he’d had ‘enough trouble for a lifetime’ — smh, JK).

324,1693099293.0,HarryPotterBooks,"What do you think? Could Voldemort ignoring Ron and Hermione have been a big mistake that might have helped him win? - We all know Voldemort’s obsession with Harry due to the prophecy, but what about his other adversaries? Did he even bother to remember Ron and Hermione’s names, let alone understand their personalities? With Wormtail by his side, who knew Harry so intimately, Voldemort had a chance to learn more about his advisors.

But did he really? Did Voldemort’s blind fixation on Harry prevent him from recognizing the potential threat posed by Ron and Hermione? Poor Hermione’s selfless act of erasing her parents’ memories in a bid to protect them might have been in vain if Voldemort didn’t even spare her a second thought.

Imagine if Voldemort had targeted Ron and Hermione strategically. Could his oversight of their importance have ultimately cost him the war? Ron’s loyalty and Hermione’s brilliance were key factors in Harry’s success, after all. By ignoring these two formidable wizards, Voldemort might have left a significant gap in his strategy that the trio exploited to their advantage."

326,1693095805.0,HarryPotterBooks,"Could Voldemort have disapparated while possessing Harry in TOotP? - I posted this in the r/harrypotter a while ago, but I want to know what the solely book community thinks.

In the Order of the Phoenix, in theory, when Voldemort was possessing Harry- do you think it would have been possible for Voldemort to disapparate away as/*with* Harry?

Here’s what we know:

1. We know you can disapparate in and out of the ministry, because in the same scene in the book, a ministry official sees Voldemort grab Bellatrix, and disapparate away. (He explicitly says “he grabbed that woman and disapparated”) 

2. We know that Voldemort’s body disappeared when he possessed Harry, because in the same scene Harry clearly says there was only Bellatrix, himself, and Dumbledore there. He says he thought that Voldemort had fled.

3. We know that you can force people to apparate with you, as the snatchers and Greyback forced the trio to apparate with them to Malfoy Manor.

4. We know that you don’t have to already know how to apparate, or have a license, to do along side apparition. Because Dumbledore apparates with Harry at the beginning of HBP, and Harry had yet to take one lesson.

However, in the GOF, Arthur takes the children to the World Cup grounds via portkey, and says something to the effect of “since you guys can’t apparate we are going by portkey” with begs the question of why could he not do side along apparition? Maybe there was an age limit? It’s not clear.

I don’t think Voldemort was limited by what Harry’s body could do magically, because Harry magically cannot possess people. So in my opinion it would not have been possible for him to stay possessing him if that were the case.

I understand *why* Voldemort did what he did, he wanted to make Dumbledore kill Harry with Voldemort inside of him. I understand Voldemort as a character, and his actions in this scene match up with who he is. So that’s not my question.

I just mean in theory, do you think it would have been possible to possess him, and a split second later just leave as/with Harry?"

Harry's Cloak is said to be stronger than other invisibility cloaks, as lesser cloaks need to have their invisibility enchantments renewed over time, but Harry's does not, and we learn why that is because Harry's Cloak is one of the Deathly Hallows. The Elder Wand is Ultra-powerful and cannot be defeated except by it's ""Rightful"" owner, the Resurrection Stone is a singularly unique magical object that can bring people back from the dead (if only temporarily).

Dumbledore is showing Harry memories that take place in the Gaunt house, where there is a lot of Parseltongue spoken (in Morfin’s memory specifically it’s almost all in Parseltongue). Obviously Dumbledore recognizes the importance of these memories and comments on them with Harry. 

Does this mean that when Dumbledore got the memories from these people that he understood what they were saying? I find it interesting that Dumbledore would hear Morfin’s memory of just a bunch of Parseltongue and not ask Harry what they were talking about if he didn’t understand it.

While he may not fully understand Muggle technology, his fascination and curiosity about their world are undeniable. Some might see his behavior as endearing and open-minded, while others might consider it slightly patronizing.

Arthur’s interactions with the Granger family, who are Muggle-born, show his genuine interest in their way of life. He’s certainly not as prejudiced as characters like Lucius Malfoy, but some argue that his fascination could sometimes border on treating Muggles like exotic curiosities.

339,1692940267.0,HarryPotterBooks,"Be honest: if you were a Tri-Wizard judge… - Would you have given Harry that grace of “moral fiber” that he was given? 

As Harry is the “main character” of the story, it makes sense in the narrative that he would come out lucky in this situation.

For me, I don’t think Karkaroff is necessarily “wrong” for believing Harry shouldn’t be given that grace. If we take away his obvious bias for preferring Victor to be champion; one could say that he was merely upholding to the rules. And that all champions went in with the same information (the song) and that there was no logical reason to believe that the “prisoners” were in any real danger. 

Similar to Igor, Dumbledore and Bagman also have a biased for Harry, Bagman in a more underhanded and shady way. Madame Maxine initially displeased when Harry first shows up, but I imagine she was won over when Harry “saved that little Delacour girl.” Percy, I think, may have privately swayed more to the “rules are rules” stance, but publicly he wanted to be in agreement with the headmaster and a ministry official. I feel like if Crouch Sr was there, he wouldn’t have been moved by Harry “acting the hero”."

362,1692637802.0,HarryPotterBooks,"Did Sirius Black’s Close Bond with James Potter Limit His Other Relationships? - One intriguing aspect is the potential contrast in their attitudes towards exclusivity and inclusion.

Sirius, possibly driven by a sense of possessiveness towards James, may have leaned towards a more insular bond. On the subconscious level, his desire to monopolize James’ attention could have led to certain actions that excluded others.  We can speculate that James played a pivotal role in inviting Remus to their group, demonstrating his inclusivity. Sirius’s influence becomes apparent in how he convinced James and Lily about the possibility of Remus being a spy after they left Hogwarts. 

Sirius also played a part in Snape’s near-death encounter with Remus as a werewolf during their school years. While this happened under the guise of a prank, it put Remus’s secret at risk and could have led to serious harm.


In contrast, James seemed to have a broader perspective on friendship. He welcomed the idea of other important individuals in his life, seeking to build connections beyond just the exclusive duo. This inclination is illuminated by his willingness to have Lily in his life. While Sirius appeared disinterested in school girls (as we see it during the owl exam in ootp). 

James, a Quidditch enthusiast, showcased his talents on the field, whereas we have little insight into Sirius’ extracurricular pursuits. 

So my main point is that while James maintained a life beyond his friendship with Sirius, the latter was distancing himself from his family and seemed less interested in forging deep relationships.

Unlike James, who had a variety of experiences like hobbies, a girlfriend, and even enemies (Snape was primarily an enemy of James), Sirius seemed to focus primarily on his friendship with James."

On the other hand, with the history between Snape and the marauders, it does seem kind of sus that Lupin’s way of bonding with his students is to humiliate Snape like that? The rest of the books do always show Lupin attempting to be civil and coexist with Snape, but Snape is a vicious bully to Neville, Hermoine and Harry in PoA and I can imagine Lupin having a real problem with that - though it still seems like an immature way to handle that problem to essentially manipulate Neville into humiliating Snape right back.

In the chapter where students are taking their Apparition exams, it's mentioned that those who turn 17 before a certain cutoff date are attending the exam, leaving just a handful of students behind for regular classes. The book explicitly names the students who were left behind due to being too young for the exams, including Harry and Draco, but Neville Longbottom's name is notably absent.

I've always been aware of the significance of both Harry and Neville in the prophecy, but this scene got me wondering why Neville wasn't mentioned. Considering the professor's remark about how young those remaining students were, it seems like Neville should have been included in that list.

Could this omission be an oversight, or is there a deeper reason for Neville's absence from the list? I'd love to hear your thoughts and insights on this, as well as any additional context from the books or author interviews that might shed light on the matter."

My favorite has to be The Deathly Hallows. 5/5, just a perfect book. My heart gushes every single time I start it. The vibes, them being in hiding, the stakes being so high. Just superb.

2. The Order of the Phoenix:
This is a close second due to Harry’s character development. I love seeing his anger and fear. I also love how secretive they are having to be about the Order. It’s just perfect, also a 5/5.

3. The Goblet of Fire:
I love this one because it is the beginning of the second war. So much detail, and so well paced.

4. Half-Blood Prince:
I feel like this is Harry’s final effort to feel normal. He’s more focused on Ginny than he is on getting Slughorns memory. I also love the dynamic with the ministry wanting to use him as a mascot.

5. The Prisoner of Azkaban:
My second favorite Character, Lupin, is introduced. ‘Nough said.

6. The Chamber of Secrets:
Love the action, love the Ford Anglia.

7. The Sorcerer’s Stone:
May be last in the list, but still amazing. Who doesn’t love baby Harry??

They are flawed and teenage boys who are growing up and going through a lot so of course it is natural where you can find instances where they could be more empathetic but there are many instances where I thought they do have a huge capacity for empathy. Harry believing Neville deserved more sympathy than he did or again him able to feel for Snape after seeing the memory despite disliking him.  Ron shows a lot of empathy understanding where Harry’s outbursts were coming from in book 5 or again he is able to understand why Sirius feels so restless stuck at home in book 5 and doesn’t judge him for it.

He puts them under the imperius curse, to show them what it feels like. Harry is the first one to fight it’s influence. So Moody makes him do it 4 times, until he can fully throw off the curse.


(Hardcover GOF pg. 232, “Moody had insisted on putting Harry through his paces four times in a row, until Harry could throw off the curse entirely.”)

Then, when Harry is in the graveyard, Voldemort tells him to answer him, and puts him under the imperius curse. It says that for the THIRD time in his life, he felt the sensation of the curse.

(Pg. 661 And Harry felt, for the third time in his life, the sensation that his mind had been wiped of all thought…”)

There are, however, times when I find her acting and behaving in an unkind and even cruel way towards Hermione and Fleur.

In GoF, she knows full-well that Rita never makes anyone look good, that she even “goes out of her way to cause trouble.” However when that “Krum-Hermione-Harry love triangle” is released, she not only believes the slander against Hermione, but also sends her a significantly smaller Easter Egg and is just plan cold to her before Harry clears things up. 

For me, it’s her clear knowledge of Rita’s antics that makes her treatment of Hermione so tactless. 

Then in HBP, she makes her usual Weasley sweater for everyone except for Fleur. This was  blatant contempt towards her son’s fiancé.  I always feel so bad for Fleur when I picture everyone on Christmas in a hand-knitted sweater, except for Fleur."

Take a look at Lucius. In ‘Order of the Phoenix,’ he’s there, right in the middle of things, but never directly hurting any of the kids.

400,1692199246.0,HarryPotterBooks,Why do you think the events at the end of Goblet of fire was the tipping point for Harry when it came to his anger instead of the other traumatic things he went through - The level of anger we see from him in book 5 isn’t really comparable to the anger we have seen from him in other books. He is obviously angry at the way the Dursley’s have treated him or at other things in the first book 4 books but it doesn’t come out as explosively. I wonder if part of the reason this anger comes out in book 5 is there has so much he has bottled up through his whole life. Then what happened at the end of book 4 was very unique. This was the first time he watched someone die in person that he remembers where he wasn’t able to save them and Voldemort is actually back and people are denying it.

402,1692193494.0,HarryPotterBooks,"Why do you think Harry, Ron and Hermione are drawn to each other? - I think Harry enjoys Ron because he's funny, which is invaluable for Harry who is constantly going through hell. Ron validates his recklessness and sometimes even surpasses it. He's easy to be around, I think there's a scene in almost every book where Ron protects/defends Harry, even against the Minister of Magic and even Voldemort, which means alot for someone who was bullied their whole life. Also, Ron and Harry think alike, even when it's an unkind thought. They share a brain in most instances. Ron is just more vocal.

Harry enjoys Hermione because she's reliable and a solid voice of reason. She's not ""fun"" but I do think she's a strong source of comfort for him. Harry sees Hermione as an annoying but beloved sibling.

Ron and Hermione are each others opposites and they fascinate each other as much as they irritate each other. Both of them are highly emotional but Ron's protectiveness and easygoing nature is good for Hermione who is very sensitive and neurotic. Plus he challenges her, which stubborn closed minded Hermione needs. Hermione is bossy in a way that Ron is familiar with because of Mrs Weasley. 

I think for Ron, Harry is a very supportive friend who accepts him as is. Ron has been ignored and put down by his brothers. He even assumes Harry will laugh at him when he practices for Quidditch because that's what he's used to. But Harry is a good friend and would never do that. Plus there's the matter of them thinking alike. Lastly, Harry is not exactly Mr Personality. Neither is Hermione. She's not the blazingly spirited Ginny. Harry's reserved and brooding. Not the life of the party. I suspect Ron likes entertaining his more socially awkward and high strung friends.

I am not sure for Hermione. She's very nurturing toward Harry. But as much as Harry and Hermione deeply love and respect each other, neither one finds the other particularly enthralling. 

You will note that I did not mention any of the generic traits, kindness, loyalty, courage. I mean regarding traits that are more or less unique to the characters.

405,1692117223.0,HarryPotterBooks,"Is Tom Riddle the best at Potions in the series? - Riddle is said to have excelled at all kinds of magic and was described by Dumbledore as the most incredible Wizard Hogwarts had ever seen. 

We have seen that making new magic is a sign of a higher level of skill in magic. For example, Dumbledore is said to have been incredible at Charms and we see him make a Protective Charm that extends Lily's Blood Sacrifice. 

We never see Voldemort do this with Charms but we do frequently with Potions. 

- The Rudimentary Body Potion which was his own invention that he was able to teach a mediocre Wizard like Wormtail to do.
- The Drink of Despair was so powerful even Dumbledore could not change its properties.
- The Body Restoration Potion shows he has extensive knowledge of obscure potions.

He is skilled enough with Potions to be able to understand how to partly circumvent Lily's Blood Sacrifice. Though perhaps not wise enough to not understand how terrible trying to exploit pure love like that is.

Snape, Slughorn and Dumbledore seem great at Potions but Riddle seems to me to be a step above them.

He is angry about Lupin using that as an argument for him to come with them and he sees the two situations as very different.

He longs for Dumbledore and to truly understand him and I think he felt they had developed this personal and close relationship so he then feels upset when he discovers that Dumbledore did share the connection they had with Godric’s Hollows. He feels lost in this mission and is starting to doubt who this man he idolised really was.

Edit to add: I understand the allegiances at this point in the story. Snape is publicly a death eater while secretly being loyal to the order.

The obvious answer is Umbridge, and after her maybe Lockhart, but if you take the string of failed DADA teachers out of the equation, I would argue that it’s without a doubt Professor Binns. Sure, Hagrid was somewhat incompetent and put students in danger a questionable amount of times, but he was passionate about his subject and seemed to genuinely care about the kids and put effort into the lessons, even if they weren’t the greatest. Sure, Snape was strict and mean, but he valued student safety and went out of his way to keep students out of danger both in and outside of the classroom. Plus, he was extremely knowledgeable and competent in his subject. Trelawney was a batty old fraud, but at the very least she, like Hagrid, cared about her subject and put in the effort to make it engaging. I cannot say the same about Binns. As a history major myself, he’s the kind of teacher who gives the subject a a bad name as a “boring” class. His droning, passionless lectures would inevitably turn my favourite subject into my least favourite. That’s no way to teach, and its certainly no way to learn.

I understand his reaction as his precedent vision saved Arthur and he was under duress. However my first thought when they returned to Hogwarts after Sirius' death was that it could have been easily avoided if he listened to Hermione.

It is clear this is a sore spot for him and then as I think as he is feeling so defensive he brings up the times he was right when he saved others. I think it shows how he hates when people in any way suggests he wants to act the hero and it is just instinctual in him to act.

C. The chamber opens for anyone who works out where it is and tell it to open in parseltongue?

440,1691555113.0,HarryPotterBooks,"Snape's mindset after Dumbledore's death - It's heartbreaking how lonely Snape must have felt after Dumbledore's death.   

The way he found Lily's letter and cried holding her ""love"" to find all the last bit of strength left in his soul. How empty he must have felt. With every moment pretending to be someone else to deceive a murdering psychopath who killed Lily and caused Dumbedore's death, with no friends cheering him on or supporting him like Harry, all alone having to gather all of his strength and courage to do what must be done. To see the hatred and disgust in the faces of people he considered moral/brave.   


The way he didn't have any other source of warmth or love/friendship in his life aside from Dumbledore.   
The way he honestly tried his best to give Harry constructive criticism and advice in the occlumency lessons, even praising him at first when he did well, which to be honest in the recent reread I was surprised how nice he sounded per Snape standards and considering their past dislike to each other. Specially considering how Harry, while understandable, was not an easy person to get along with in OoP, even Hermione and Ron had to be blunt and tell Harry to stop acting like a jerk.   


Snape was not perfect but he is a very realistic character. In reality lack of friends, support or love, lack of family and care, these things poison the mind and soul. Not to mention being ostracized by groups of people, having to stand your own, to be brave against the grain with only your morals left as company against giving up and surrendering to death.  


It is incredibly rare to be a caring, healthy person after that. How many seemingly good people show lack of morals when in tough situations? How many are brave to stand up against their friends when they see their friends are being unjust or unkind? How many people in real life choose the easy way and just look the other way? In fear of confrontation, of losing their friends or their place in the social groups around them. Did Remus ever stand up against his friends? Did James or Sirius ever care to think how arrogant they were being? Or how harmful their actions towards Snape was. Did they ever think how arrogant it is to keep a ""friend"" like Peter around because of his total admiration of them and his cowardice?   


People are complex and actions matter more than words. It is easy to not be an envious person like Snape when cared well for like James and praised and admired by everyone around. Even Remus though having friends, was scared to speak out out of fear of being left alone with no support of friends.   
Easy to be a happy uplifting person when you are not so utterly alone. Loneliness, isolation and lack of support, lack of friends these things rarely result in healthy individuals. 

Lily was not enough to change Snape but he was fighting and trying his best to be someone she would keep in her life. But the resentment he felt against James and the fear he felt that Lily would leave him for someone like James, poisoned his soul further.  


 I do think Snape would have been happy even if Lily married someone else, as long as she kept him in her life as a friend she cared about. She was his link to becoming a better person, a person worthy of friendship and love/care of people he deemed moral, good and kind/brave. All good things he wanted to be and wanted to have in people around him.   
It is not Lily's fault Snape was into dark arts and became a death eater but Snape did not have any other ties to the kind of people he would have wanted to be. He had spent his many years putting all his hopes and showing his best side to Lily.   


He put Lily on a pedestal, and I think he thought as long as she was his friend, he had a hope to be a good person. I have seen this happen in real life many times. People who grow up isolated and lonely tend to cling to one person and put all of their hopes and efforts to that one person only to be abandoned or betrayed by that person. And the cycle usually continues. They can't immediately form healthy relationships or friendships with multiple different people. Can't form ties and belong to social groups that support them or guide them.   


Think of how many social nets many people belong to or how many people they know to count on in times of difficulty for support or care. For friendship or advice.   
Imagine all of that is nonexistent and of course  such a person won't have the tools to form healthy relationships out of nothing. Not to mention in a time of war and high stress. All the years of resentment and prejudice against people harassing or bullying, ostracizing them do not make a trusting friendly person.   


People like this often are distrusting of others and think being alone will protect them of others bullying and harassment. That being alone is the only way they won't get hurt again.  


But Snape made a mistake, he ruined his friendship with someone he cared about more than anything else and he wasn't strong enough to get out of the dark path in such a short time.   


I think everything must have happened too fast, suddenly it was no longer a youthful resentment or the competition between houses, no longer injustice or prejudice against people making his life hell,  no longer just a group Snape felt he belonged in and could academically learn more about magic and dark magic, to use his mind to figure out complex rules of magic and have the support where he felt strong and admired even.  


 Suddenly it was deathes everywhere, not to mention Voldemort giving direct orders to Snape.  
 Again I am not saying Snape was perfect, he did make a mistake and he did fall to the darkness in his soul but he suffered for it immensely. He sacrificed everything to find the bit of soul in himself that could be saved, and could give him strength to do what must be done.  

Snape swore to protect Harry and the students of Hogwarts. Did everything he could to save people's lives. Hated himself and wanted to end his existence and his suffering so much that the only way he could will himself to live was to be useful in the right cause of avenging Lily's death to keep her son alive and to end Voldemort once and for all. Which Dumbledore strategically used to his advantage. It takes incredible bravery, and guts to do that.   


 To grow up as he did and in Slytherin under bad influence, to cling so much to Lily as his longing towards what he considered good and moral person. How much he tried to go towards that light, to fight against the darkness.   


To be fair I think if Lily was more mature or wiser, if she didn't give up on Snape so easily, or didn't think so black and white about people, things would be different. I'm not saying Lily should have ended up with Snape, but that Snape seemed to value their friendship much more than Lily did. Lily shouldn't have given up on him so easily. Specially considering the extreme humiliation Snape had just suffered when he said those words.   


Lily seemed like a slightly shallow person who believed people are who they seem on the surface. Believed people are as good or as bad as they pretend to be.   
However much Petunia was truly awful, how much did Lily actually try to spend time with her sister? Or make an honest effort? Or did she with James just make fun of her sister and her sister's family? It seems she chose the easy way, a simpler way of looking at people, and it is not surprising she ended up with someone like James and overlooked all the bullying and humiliation Snape had suffered under James and Sirius.  


 Don't get me wrong, I think James and Sirius were incredibly brave, but I think they were too shallow and not great judges of character.   
Again as in real life, many people choose the simpler way, a person who is popular and outwardly  friendly will be supported even if he is not a good person. A person is made fun of and socially inept? He will be ostracized even if he is a good person.   


Best examples in Harry's life of this were Luna and Neville. And even though Harry also seemed ashamed of his friends in OoP, he became wiser and more mature when he later stood by his friends and grew as a person. I liked this about Ginny too, how her best friend was Luna and how she didn't seem to care about social popularity (even though she was popular herself) and would stand her ground and by her principles.   


Furthermore I think it shows what kind of person Snape is that he spent the rest of his life sorry, and in agony, never choosing the easy way which would have been to rationalize his choices and join Lucius and other death eaters in their beliefs, specially when they were welcoming to Snape.  


 He chose the most difficult road, he chose to hurt inside, to suffer but know that he was making the moral choice, that he was fighting for the right side, to avenge Lily's death, to  defeat Voldemort and his supporters. And do all of this alone, with only Dumbledore who was aware of this.  


Snape also grew a lot as a person as shown in his last reaching out to harry through his memories.   
As many people have already analyzed Prince's Tale, he apologized through showing Harry memory of Albus saying he sees what he wants to see.  That he is prejudiced against Harry. And the memory where Dumbledore says Harry is more like his mother than his father. Snape took note of this, enough to deliberately show Harry.  

Showed Harry that he was cognizant of his own flaw. The way he showed Harry Dumbledore's remark about ""we sort too soon"", that Dumbledore called him brave. How he was touched by that remark. Oh how different his life would have been if he had been sorted to Gryffindor from the beginning with Lily. But perhaps then the war would have been lost without someone like Snape to be a spy.  


It was heartbreaking as we see with Harry the actual person Snape was underneath. And I am very glad Harry was mature enough to realize that, and to let everyone including Voldemort know in the final battle how brave Snape was. The way he honored Snape by naming his son after him.   


And how Severus, James, Sirius and Lily's names would live on as siblings, with the past prejudices left behind."

451,1691354756.0,HarryPotterBooks,"Hogwarts’ History of Dark Magic Wizards and Witches - I’ve been a fan of the series for a long time now and am in the process of rereading the series and delving deeper into the fandom and lore. During my current read of the books, I can’t help but wonder how such a small, intimate community could produce so many dark magic users. Hogwarts is the only magic school in the U.K. which already has a relatively small magic population. Despite it being mentioned that there was a possibility for Draco to attend Durmstrang, it appears that a grand majority of U.K. wizards and witches attend Hogwarts.

That being said, there are multiple instances of some dark and shady practices taking place at Hogwarts with seemingly no repercussions. I mean, it’s a recurring joke in the community that Hogwarts isn’t exactly the safest to begin with (A chamber with a basilisk, security like Fluffy, questionable dark arts professors, the forbidden forest, etc.) Still, I can’t help but wonder something…

With a relatively low population in a pretty tight-knit community, how did Hogwarts produce so many dark witches and wizards? I understand how Voldemort could have coerced, threatened and manipulated people post-graduation, but I’m talking about while at Hogwarts.

Draco Malfoy openly uses the term “mudblood” and it seems like nothing comes of it. Even after the trio tell Hagrid (who may not have been a professor at the time but was still Hogwarts staff) there’s no indication that Dumbledore or any other authority figure was told. In the Deathly Hallows, during Snape’s flashback, we see Lily lecturing Snape on how his friends Mulciber and Avery seemingly perform dark magic on a regular enough basis that it’s notable. Just after that, Lily points out how everyone knows that their group is aiming to become Death Eaters. What??

I’m sorry, but how did the school not get involved? If there was a mini cult being formed in the school it’s unbelievable how seemingly nothing is done about it. Part of me wants to play devil’s advocate and say that it could’ve been handled “off-screen” in a sense, but even during Harry’s time there seems to be little to no effort on the school’s part to address these issues. We see some lighter punishments for sneaking around, inappropriate use of magic, etc. get dolled out, but I feel like Hogwarts didn’t do much to bridge the gap between the Pure-blood and Muggle-born witches and wizards. 

I understand that things couldn’t have been perfect- I remember how in school things would take place under the radar and would get swept under the rug at times. However, Hogwarts is a really small community and everyone lives there throughout the school year. Why were there no lectures from the staff to the students about how Muggle-borns are no different from their other magical peers? I keep trying to tell myself that this was a series aimed at a younger audience so maybe the evil vs. good, bad guys vs. good guys was made to be more black and white for that reason, but I still feel like it’s not good enough. Especially with a series full of so many rich, complex, gray characters… Those are just my thoughts, is there an explanation for some of these issues that maybe were explained elsewhere?

I don't know if her thoughts on him from the podcast ""The Witch Trials of J.K. Rowling"" (Episode 2) have already been shared on this sub. Anyway, here they are and here's the link to the episode: [https://www.therowlinglibrary.com/2023/02/21/j-k-rowling-talks-about-dumbledore-and-snape-excerpts-from-the-witch-trials-of-j-k-rowling-episode-2/](https://www.therowlinglibrary.com/2023/02/21/j-k-rowling-talks-about-dumbledore-and-snape-excerpts-from-the-witch-trials-of-j-k-rowling-episode-2/).

""In my worldview, conscience speaks in a very small and inconvenient voice, and it’s normally saying to you “think again, look more deeply, consider this.” And I was struck early on actually in the “Potter” phenomenon by how the two characters that cause the most furious debate, and I’m actually using the word furious quite literally there at times, were Dumbledore and Snape. People wanted Dumbledore to be perfect. He’s deeply flawed. But to me, he is an exemplar of goodness. He did wrong. He learnt. He grew wise. But he has to make the difficult decisions that people in the real world have to make. Very difficult decisions.

Meanwhile, you have Snape. Incontrovertible a bully, he can be mean, he can be sadistic, he’s bitter. But he is courageous. He is determined to make good what he did terribly wrong. And without him, disaster would have occurred. And I have had fans really angry at me for not categorizing Snape in particular. Just wanting clarity in simplicity, let’s just agree this is a really bad guy. And I’m thinking when I can’t agree with you because I know him. But also I can’t agree with you, full stop, because people can be deeply flawed.

People can make mistakes. People can do bad things. In fact, show me the human being who hasn’t. And they can also be capable of greatness. And I mean greatness in a moral sense, not in a fame or an achievement sense."""

457,1691207131.0,HarryPotterBooks,"Crookshanks is Hermione -   Before I get bashed or anything in the comments, I mainly wrote this theory for fun, it’s not meant to be taken very seriously(even though it makes a lot of sense:0)

 What if Hermione is actually crookshanks in animagus form. Now to address the elephant in the room, regarding how crookshanks and Hermione would be in the same room together(as they are in many instances), I believe the Hermione that would be crookshanks is actually a future version of Hermione, but not too far into the future like cursed child. 
 
Lets imagine a situation a couple years after hermione graduates from Hogwarts, She and Ron are married, both working in the ministry of magic(all of that is canon). Both Ron and Hermione are facing extreme boredom, most likely, because the extremely eventful 7 years at Hogwarts are no more, and even though they faced great danger, they both dearly missed those days. Ron and Hermione have grown a bit distant from harry(still great friends but just don’t see each other as much as they wished), because their both doing their own lives now(this part is all theory, but if you think about it it’s probably true) Most importantly though, Hermione turns learns to become an animagus, adopting the form of a cat.
  
Teddy Lupin is finally starting to grow up, but without his mother and father. Harry, even though he has accepted Sirius’s death and finished grieving, his absence still gives him some sadness. Ron and the entire Weasley family are the same way, come to accept Fred’s death but still sad over it. Overall, life is a little depressing, not as special as it used to be for Hermione, and that’s when she has an idea. 
   
 She could use a time turner, go back to her third year at Hogwarts, disguised as crookshanks, and kill Pettigrew. That way, Voldemort wouldn’t be able to come back and kill all those people, she could even save Cedric, and then she’d be able to relive the years she wished she could go back to, but this time in the safety of being a cat. When she finally catches up to her present time, things would be much better. So she does it, and that’s how Hermione can be crookshanks and get still be in the same room as her original self. 
      
   Now Hermione knows she can’t show herself to anyone, even teenage Hermione, because she’d violate the time travel rules. So she goes into diagon alley and gets adopted by Hermione, so that she has the perfect opportunity to eat Pettigrew, but Ron gets in the way and teenage Hermione won’t let adult Hermione near Pettigrew enough to kill him. and the story unfolds as it did in canon.
     
   It actually seems a very likely way how crookshanks knew both scabbers and the black dog were animagus’s. Because 1(Crookshanks is an animagus herself), and 2(Crookshanks is from the future). No normal cat could have known that. I’ve always thought there was something extra going on with her, like a secret she’s hiding.

460,1691178612.0,HarryPotterBooks,"How was Hagrid originally supposed to bring Harry to 4 Privet Drive? - Let's ignore for a moment the plot hole where-in Hagrid, with a flying motorbike, needed almost 24 hours to fly from the West Country in England to Little Whinging in South Eastern England. Hagrid originally went to Godric's Hollow to grab Harry and transport him to 4 Privet Drive with no knowledge that Sirius would not only be present but also lend him his bike.

So what was the original plan? How was Hagrid, who cannot Apparate and isn't allowed to have a wand and thus not allowed to hail the Knight's Bus, supposed to bring Harry to 4 Privet Drive? The fact that Hagrid chose to use Sirius' motorbike proves he had no real plan originally. No ""Oh, I'll just visit Bathilda Bagshot and use her Floo"" (to Floo to somewhere close to Little Whinging) or something, because that would have been infinitely faster."

462,1691132327.0,HarryPotterBooks,"Why did the Ministry stop looking after Sirius once he escaped his Hogwarts cell? - One thing that never sat right with me was the fact that Fudge actually acknowledges in Book 3 the fact that the Ministry is aware of the fact Voldemort is alive and their main concern is that Sirius's end goal is to bring him back. Yet in the next book he does a 180 on it and refuses to acknowledge that Voldemort might be back despite knowing that (what he supposed was) one of his most loyal servants is on the loose.

Now I can understand why Fudge decided to tone down the manhunt and sent the Dementors back to Azkaban in GoF... after all Britain was hosting two major international sporting events. But still I can't understand why would it be such a hard thing for him to wrap his head around the fact that Voldemort was back when he knew that Sirius was at large and Voldemort was alive (and Voldemort being alive is not even such a big secret since Rosmerta also knows about it).

Here's the quote from PoA, Ch. 10:

> ""But what do you think he's broken out to do?"" said Madam Rosmerta. ""Good gracious, Minister, he isn't trying to rejoin You-Know-Who, is he?""

> ""I daresay that is his -- er -- eventual plan,"" said Fudge evasively.
""But we hope to catch Black long before that. I must say, You-Know-Who
alone and friendless is one thing... but give him back his most devoted
servant, and I shudder to think how quickly he'll rise again....""

So do you think Fudge was more afraid of admitting to having fucked up with regards to his manhunt for Sirius or of dealing with Voldemort? Thoughts?"

464,1691105191.0,HarryPotterBooks,"Why did Hermione and Ron not believe Harry in half blood? - It’s been two months since I’ve read the books as I finally finished the entire series for the first time (yay!) one of the things that bothered me about half-blood prince is how Hermione and Ron didn’t/dismissed Harry when he brought up that Draco was branded with the death mark. On the top of my head, when they are getting new robes, Harry notices that Draco is trying his best to hide his arm until he slips up. Harry notices and then tells them both about it. They dismiss him throughout the entire book when in the last couple of books; they believed him. I feel like it’s out of character for them because they have a lot of trust in Harry. Also, Draco’s father being in jail for being a death-eater, & having the knowledge that their has been death-eaters in the school. I know narcissa isn’t a death eater, so that argument can quickly crumble. 

I chalked it up to be that they feared that Harry was projecting his trauma onto Draco considering everything they were going through. Yet, I feel like Harry had good reasons to suspect him & I find it odd that Hermione & Ron didn’t. 

So it’s interesting to me. This is from the top of my head, and I don’t have the physical book in front of me. I may have missed some key details. Please let me know your thoughts! This always bothered me and I hope someone can explain :)"

466,1691043074.0,HarryPotterBooks,"Snape is the best character in the series - Just finished a reread, and I think I’ve come to the conclusion that this fella has it all. Easily one of the funniest characters, one of the best teachers in the school, and ultimately cares about his student, even the ones he hates.

One of the big complaints is that Snape is biased towards the Slytherins, but I think it’s important to note the rest of the house heads are too so it’s not exactly a fair gripe. Minerva McGonagall literally bent the rules for Quidditch membership and brooms policy(a major source of points for her house) and also gave reduced homework loads before critical matches. I think professor Sprout even gave Harry the cold shoulder in GOF after he was selected as a second champion, and while I’m not sure if Flitwick ever did anything of the sort, he may just be the exception not the rule. Also not gonna even mention Dumbledore adding bajillions of points right at the buzzer to boost Gryffindor. So bias - moot point.

Is Snape mean to the students? Yeah. But honestly who cares. Most of what he does is pretty light, and tbh he teaches a course where literally all you have to do is pay attention and follow instructions so no wonder he gets frustrated after spending years of watching people incapable of reading through what they need to do thoroughly. All you have to do in potions is follow instructions. Harry proves this case and point when he is literally able to ace Slughorn’s course (even beating out Hermione) based on Snape’s jot notes! Take in this guy has been teaching him for five years - and he didn’t start internalizing it until sixth year."
467,1691038398.0,HarryPotterBooks,"Chamber of secrets is underrated. -   I hate that everyone puts chamber of secrets as they’re least favorite Harry Potter book. I get no one dislikes the book or anything, usually people will just say(well one of them has to be last and this one’s boring) but it’s(unpopular opinion incoming) easily top 3 in the series, if not second best behind goblet of fire, in my opinion at-least. 
    First of all it perfectly captures the whimsical fantasy vibe(the book has great vibes, and nostalgia) while also being an upgraded version of the first one. It’s the perfect embodiment of what a Harry Potter book is supposed to be, with quidditch, Hagrids hut, giant spiders, going to Hogwarts 🎃(Halloween feast) and classes etc, the trio sneaking around the castle and getting into trouble. Now I know the other books have that but they seem like kind of an afterthought, chamber of secrets really focuses on those aspects you think of when thinking of Harry Potter. Now PS does the same thing but this time we have real danger and some more interesting plot points, philosophers stone feels very 1 dimensional and child-like while chamber of secrets reads almost perfectly. 
      The main reason I like Cos so much is it’s “finale” or “third act”. It’s probably the best in the series in my opinion, at-least from when hermione gets petrified to Aragog to their escape from the chamber of secrets. So much is at stake. It also has a great mystery aspect to it, like there’s a lot of questions posed throughout the book that keep you engaged. 
     Overall I like it’s a little underrated. If you wonder what I put at the last spot I’d put deathly hallows, I know that’s controversial but it just feels the least like a Harry Potter book. The only time we see Hogwarts it’s getting destroyed, it just feels different and there’s no nostalgia too it either."

474,1690865872.0,HarryPotterBooks,"How did Grindelwald become Master of the Elder wand? - So at the end of the book, Harry is just making Voldemort cope, and when he’s screeching about how Tom isn’t very emotionally intelligent and that he doesn’t have an adequate understanding of not just love but wandlore as well there’s thing that trips me up.

Harry tells Voldemort that he can’t equip the wand, despite being a high level dark wizard, because possessing it (stealing it) isn’t enough and he had to win it. Harry then goes on to explain that basically through a convoluted chain of events he is the master of the wand - but all of this relies on Dumbledore being the true master.

We all know Dumbledore won the wand from Grindelwald in the big old Nazi duelathon in the forties, but there’s a scene in the TDH earlier on that really confuses me about how Grindelwald came to take full possession of the wand. Harry has this dream where he is seeing through Voldemort who is seeing through Grigorovich who sees Grindelwald STEAL the elder wand from him sans any form of combat.  If the wand lore logic holds, wouldn’t this mean that Grindelwald never won the wand, meaning Dumbledore never was the true master,  meaning Harry’s lengthy monologue is actually just meaningless?

What are your theories on this? Was Grigorovich actually the master of the wand or not ? If not how did it come into his possession? Did the actual master pawn it off to him as a fun collectable item only to be caught lacking by a teenage maniac sometime in the thirties who only later showed up in Bulgaria to claim his winnings?"

477,1690837302.0,HarryPotterBooks,"Why didn't Dumbledore help Karkaroff? - I just listened to an episode of a podcast (The Real Weird Sisters) that does character studies on the HP characters where the hosts talked about Igor Karkaroff and it got me thinking about his arc in the series. In GoF, Karkaroff was clearly afraid of Voldemort's return and he was seeking Snape, a fellow former death eater, out for help. It is obvious he didn't want to join Voldemort again (mostly because he was too afraid after ratting some death eaters out after the first wizarding war). He fled and was later killed, presumably by one of Voldemort's followers.
So I am wondering why Dumbledore didn't offer Karkaroff help and protection or why he didn't try to get him to work for him. He knew about Karkaroff's fear, because Snape told him about it. We see Dumbledore offer help and protection to others who are or have been on the wrong path, e. g. Draco, Snape etc.
Do you think he didn't do that with Karkaroff because he did not trust him enough? I personally wouldn't have trusted Draco either (as his family who he was loyal to was full of dark wizards and witches), yet Dumbledore tried to protect him. Why not try to do the same for Igor Karkaroff?
Would love to hear some ideas!

TLDR: Karkaroff didn't want to rejoin Voldemort's side and was afraid. Why didn't Dumbledore, who was privy to his situation, try to help or protect him or try to have him work for him?"

Harry is also very worried about Sirius and doesn’t want to hear her logical points as he believes Sirius is in real danger but I think he mistook her point when she says he has a saving people thing as Hermione means it more an in he feels compelled to help and save people by taking matters into his own hands and this could be exploited. I think Hermione was tactful but Harry just couldn’t admit in that moment he could have a hero complex and he was panicking

It all started when Hogwarts Legacy was released, I loved that game played it for hours and fell in love with everything there was about the game, my best friend is a potterhead and she  always recommended that I read the books, after finishing the game I decided it was time to readt them, and oh boy was I glad that I did.

It got me completely hooked, nah scratch that got me addicted, I rarely read books but there I was reading 4 hours straight because I just couldn't stop and had to know what happened next.

After finishing the books I watched the movies and yes some of them are different but they are good anyways. I just couldn't believe how truly magical these characters and world are which is a beautiful yet ironic coincidence considered what the books are mainly about, magic!

As the tittle says Harry Potter changed my life, there will always be a before an after reading these books and my only regret is that I waited until I was 30 years old to do it.

I laughed, I cried, I was stressed out(looking at you camping part in deathly hallows) but it all made me realize how much a better person I can be. Now, I want to study hard as Hermione, be brave as Ron and always do the right thing as Harry did so many times.

I’ve already flown through the series in a couple weeks just like I used to as kid/teen. I want to continue reading but I’ve been out of the bookworm game so long that I have no idea where to go next.

Does anyone have good fantasy genre recommendations after finishing the series? It doesn’t have to be YA but something in the same vein of magic and mystical creatures etc. Or just something that scratches the same itch.

I hope this is okay to ask here. But I know y’all love HP as much, if not more, than I do and can give the best recommendations :)

Edit: Thank you everyone for so many great book suggestions! I’m really excited to read a bunch of these! My inner bookworm has been reborn 🥹"

I imagine him being part of Dumbledore’s Army, and returning for the battle at Hogwarts. I believe Cedric could have been a source of comfort, support, and loyalty in books 5-7.

500,1690376900.0,HarryPotterBooks,"Is Dumbledore obfuscatingly eccentric, or is he just a weird dude sometimes? - There is a trope called [obfuscating stupidity](https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ObfuscatingStupidity), which is essentially playing dumb to hide intentions or gain an advantage. I’m wondering if Dumbledore was instead obfuscatingly eccentric? Or was he just genuinely kind of a weirdo?

Dumbledore is an eccentric bloke: 

> *“Even if I could [do something about Harry’s lightning scar], I wouldn’t. Scars can come in handy. I have one myself above my left knee that is a perfect map of the London Underground. Well — give him here, Hagrid — we’d better get this over with.”* 

…

> *Professor Dumbledore enjoys chamber music and ten-pin bowling.*

…

> *“Welcome!” he said. “Welcome to a new year at Hogwarts! Before we begin our banquet, I would like to say a few words. And here they are: Nitwit! Blubber! Oddment! Tweak!”* 

> *“Thank you!”* 

> *He sat back down. Everybody clapped and cheered. Harry didn’t know whether to laugh or not.* 

> *“Is he — a bit mad?” he asked Percy uncertainly.* 

> *“Mad?” said Percy airily. “He’s a genius! Best wizard in the world! But he is a bit mad, yes. Potatoes, Harry?”*

…

> Now, enough questions. I suggest you make a start on these sweets. Ah! Bertie Bott’s Every Flavor Beans! I was unfortunate enough in my youth to come across a vomit-flavored one, and since then I’m afraid I’ve rather lost my liking for them — but I think I’ll be safe with a nice toffee, don’t you?” 

> He smiled and popped the golden-brown bean into his mouth. Then he choked and said, “Alas! Ear wax!”

…

> *“Oh I would never dream of assuming I know all Hogwarts’ secrets, Igor,” said Dumbledore amicably. “Only this morning, for instance, I took a wrong turn on the way to the bathroom and found myself in a beautifully proportioned room I have never seen before, containing a really rather magnificent collection of chamber pots. When I went back to investigate more closely, I discovered that the room had vanished. But I must keep an eye out for it. Possibly it is only accessible at five-thirty in the morning. Or it may only appear at the quarter moon — or when the seeker has an exceptionally full bladder.”*

> *Harry snorted into his plate of goulash. Percy frowned, but Harry could have sworn Dumbledore had given him a very small wink.*

His weirdness continues into the latter books, but he also becomes more grave, or serious, naturally as the narrative darkens. He reins it in a little, I mean. So does Dumbledore put on an eccentric persona, or is he actually just a bit of an oddball at times? 

I think his eccentricities were genuine. But his advantage, and genius, was his ability to switch into these different ‘modes’ instantly. In one moment he could be the kind, eccentric old wizard, then in the next he could be like this: 

> *The look upon Dumbledore’s face as he stared down at the unconscious form of Mad-Eye Moody was more terrible than Harry could have ever imagined. There was no benign smile upon Dumbledore’s face, no twinkle in the eyes behind the spectacles. There was cold fury in every line of the ancient face; a sense of power radiated from Dumbledore as though he were giving off burning heat.*

When the situation calls for it, Dumbledore casts aside all the ‘silly’ parts of his character. He does it again in *Order of the Phoenix*: 

> *Directly above them, framed in the doorway from the Brain Room, stood Albus Dumbledore, his wand aloft, his face white and furious. Harry felt a kind of electric charge surge through every particle of his body — they were saved.*

And in *Half-Blood Prince*: 

> *Harry glanced sideways at Dumbledore, ready to grab him should he fall, but the sight of the Dark Mark seemed to have acted upon Dumbledore like a stimulant: He was bent low over his broom, his eyes fixed upon the Mark, his long silver hair and beard flying behind him on the night air.*

This ability to switch between different modes gives Dumbledore tremendous *depth*, because all aspects of him are authentic."
501,1690330230.0,HarryPotterBooks,"Dobby had some sort of sense that the diary was more than just a way to open the Chamber but was a horcrux - It’s stated that even Lucius didn’t know it was a Horcrux- but he knew it was a way to reopen the Chamber.

If Dobby knows about the Chamber and “history repeating itself” then he would know that the monster within targets Muggleborns, even if he doesn’t know what exactly lies within the chamber. 

Dobby knows Harry is not Muggleborn yet comes to warn HIM specifically that he is in danger, implying he knows that it’s Voldemort who is indirectly going to catalyze these events, and therefore eventually target Harry.

Dobby kinda says no when Harry asks if it has to do with Lord Voldemort, and later in the book says it was a clue because it was Tom Riddle before he went by the name Voldemort.

How would he know any of that, based on even Lucius’s limited knowledge of what the diary truly is?  Only if he kinda knew it was more than what it seemed, even when wizards didn’t sense it. 

Kreacher also says during Regulus’s Tale that he figured out the locket contained an ancient evil that even he could not destroy.  

So I posit that house elf magic, given that they can override some other wizarding rules of magic, can sense other ancient magic like horcruxes"

504,1690308626.0,HarryPotterBooks,"Snape’s Motivations… - **...and why it’s not revenge.**

Often debated, as is everything that surrounds Snape, let's have a look at this motivations for fighting against Voldemort.

**- “Anything.”**

Luckily for us, there is not much speculating to do here, as Snape (and Dumbledore) clearly states why he’s betraying Voldemort.

>“Hide them all, then,” he croaked. “Keep her – them – safe. Please.”  
>  
>“And what will you give me in return, Severus?”  
>  
>“In – in return?” Snape gaped at Dumbledore, and Harry expected him to protest, but after a long moment he said, “Anything.”

Snape is bartering Lily and her family’s safety (yes, especially Lily) against what we know is his service as a spy, among other things. He’s giving his loyalty to Dumbledore in an attempt to save Lily Potter.

At this point Snape is desperate, to a point where he’s ready to risk his life several times to try and correct the thing that will haunt him for all his life, giving the prophecy to Voldemort. He asked Voldemort to spare Lily, and, since Lily was the only one he had cared about, he could have settled for Voldemort's promise. But he did not, which suggests that his faith in Voldemort had already been shaken and/or that whatever he had verbalized, his actions proved that he cared more about Lily and even her family than his own life.

The Snape in this scene is panicking, afraid, he thought it possible that Dumbledore would kill him on the spot, yet Snape still went to ask for Dumbledore’s help in protecting his own soldiers (Master Manipulator Dumbledore here, asking for a life of service in return for… doing something he would have most likely done anyway).

Snape’s initial motivation is love. Love for his former best friend and possibly the only person he ever truly loved and who did love him back. He loves Lily, and wishes for her to be safe.

**- “I wish...I wish I were dead...”**

Lily dies, and that’s where the issues in understanding arise. Many people have - incorrectly - deducted that the reason Snape stays on Dumbledore’s side after Lily’s death is a thirst for revenge. Yet once again, Snape’s motivation is served to us on a silver platter.

>“I wish...I wish I were dead...”  
>  
>“And what use would that be to anyone?” said Dumbledore coldly. “If you loved Lily Evans, if you truly loved her, then your way forward is clear.”  
>  
>\[...\]  
>  
>“You know how and why she died. Make sure it was not in vain. **Help me protect Lily’s son.**”  
>  
>“He does not need protection. The Dark Lord has gone – ”  
>  
>“The Dark Lord will return, and Harry Potter will be in terrible danger when he does.”  
>  
>There was a long pause, and slowly Snape regained control of himself, mastered his own breathing. At last he said, “**Very well.** Very well. But never – never tell, Dumbledore! This must be between us! Swear it! I cannot bear...especially Potter’s son...I want your word!”  
>  
>“My word, Severus, that I shall never reveal the best of you?” Dumbledore sighed, looking down into Snape’s ferocious, anguished face. “If you insist...”

Master Manipulator Dumbledore is back, and this time it’s to secure himself a bodyguard for the Chosen One. In doing so, he gives Snape a reason to live.

The reason Snape stayed at Hogwarts to teach, and the reason he not only stayed on Dumbledore’s side but agreed to be an active part once the fight begins again, is to protect Harry Potter, in honor of Lily’s sacrifice.

An interesting thing to note here is that this motivation is directly coming from the first, love, and that there is however nothing about Snape’s thoughts on Voldemort and the Death Eaters.

We do not know for sure why Snape joined the Death Eaters. We know he used the word “mudblood”, as well as had a pretty negative opinion of Muggles, and liked Dark Magic but we also know that Snape was someone who was ambitious and in dire need of power and place to belong. Most likely it’s a mix of all those things that made him fall prey to the grooming of Voldemort and his followers.

At this point in time, it’s a fair assumption to make that Snape has possibly not yet broken free of the thoughts and ideas that made him join Voldemort in the first place, whatever they may have been.

**- “So the boy...the boy must die?”**

A small, yet extremely important point that further illustrates Snape’s character development, Harry’s necessary death. Not only did Snape have to come to terms with the fact that all these years he’d protected Harry only for him to be pretty much sacrificed at the proper moment, but he had to be one to lead him to it.

Snape’s one, primary motivation that he had carried with him since Lily’s death, was now gone. Yet, he kept going. He did what was asked of him (probably one of the worst things he ever had to do at that), knowing that Harry was going to die. This shows that at this point in his life, Snape indeed had other motivations for fighting Voldemort.

**- “Always.”**

Cliché quote, but there’s no going around it, because it tells us everything we need to know, which is more than you may think.

>“I have spied for you and lied for you, put myself in mortal danger for you. **Everything was supposed to be to keep Lily Potter’s son safe**. Now you tell me you have been raising him like a pig for slaughter – ”  
>  
>“But this is touching, Severus,” said Dumbledore seriously. “Have you grown to care for the boy, after all?”  
>  
>“For him?” shouted Snape. “Expecto Patronum!”  
>  
>From the tip of his wand burst the silver doe. She landed on the office floor, bounded once across the office, and soared out of the window. Dumbledore watched her fly away, and as her silvery glow faded he turned back to Snape, and his eyes were full of tears.  
>  
>“After all this time?”  
>  
>“**Always**,” said Snape.

Here we are told once again, very clearly, that Snape did what he did to keep Harry Potter safe, and that he does so in Lily’s memory, and not out of affection for Harry.

However, there is another element in this scene that suggests *another* motivation.

>“Don’t be shocked, Severus. How many men and women have you watched die?”  
>  
>“**Lately, only those whom I could not save**,” said Snape.

Severus Snape saves people’s lives. As much as he can, he does his best to save lives. This is perfectly illustrated in the Battle of the Seven Potters where Snape sees a Death Eater about to curse Remus Lupin, and tries to intervene (thus disobeying direct orders from Dumbledore). He has repeatedly in the story either shown concern (for Ginny in CoS) or saved the lives (Katie Bell in HBP) of people who had nothing to do either with the fight against Voldemort, or protecting Harry Potter.

To most people, this would seem normal, after all if you have the power and skill to save others, even more if you’re in a position of authority over them, you should do it. This however, was not normal for the young Severus Snape who went to Albus Dumbledore more than 15 years prior. During that time, Snape learned the value of human life.

He risks his life to save others, not just Harry, and not just for Harry. This is another motivation, which we could call “doing the right thing”.

**- Where is the revenge?**

Pretty well hidden. So well hidden in fact that it’s nowhere in the books. It’s easy to see why many seem to think that Snape was doing all of this for revenge, as some of the elements are there. Snape was hurt (through Lily’s death), and he does fight the person who hurt him. However, there’s something lacking.

Never, in any of the books, do we see Snape being angry at Voldemort, or even just blame him for Lily’s death. *Snape’s immediate reaction is to blame himself.* As a comparison, Sirius Black’s immediate reaction is to blame Peter Pettigrew. Maybe he’s too busy hating himself, but Snape does not seek retribution against Voldemort.

Severus Snape’s motivations are love and protection. Protection of Harry, in Lily’s memory, and protection of others, because it’s the kind of man he’s grown into, someone who saves others at the risk of his own, expecting nothing in return.

506,1690255508.0,HarryPotterBooks,"Hermione and Marietta - This has been asked thousands of times, and answered, and usually people will say Hermione was right to jinx Marietta, but my unpopular opinion is not only that she was wrong but downright cruel. I don’t know why more people don’t talk about this. I’ll add that Hermione is usually one of my favorite Harry Potter characters. Here’s why she was wrong in jinxing Marietta: 

 1. Dumbledores army is an illegal organization! Yes I know the DA members are good guys, and Umbridge is a bad guy, but look at it from Marietta’s viewpoint. She didn’t know Voldermort was back, and the ministry specifically states that those rumors are to be stomped out immediately. The point is that no matter the intentions, dumbledores army is actively breaking school rules, for all she knows the DA is really dangerous, and *Hermione has no right to punish another student for following the rules(as Mariettas been taught her whole life) and turning them in* And people will say, “Well they could’ve been expelled, Marietta’s choice to snitch almost had serious consequences,” but if they all got expelled it’s because they broke the rules. You can’t brake the rules and then blame the person who got you caught. 
 
 2. She didn’t tell them about the jinx beforehand. Now I do agree that if she specifically told them all about the jinx, and made them agree to not snitch beforehand or their would be consequences, then Marietta brought it on herself. Instead Hermione is basically forcing her to do illegal stuff, she has no way out. You have to tell people that once you’re in the army it’s a commitment, you can’t leave, but poor Marietta only found that out when it was too late. 
 
  3. The jinx was cruel and unnecessary. Basically the whole point of the jinx was to take it out on someone else, so that if someone snitched eat least their life is ruined. Some people will say that the point of it was to find out who snitched so they can’t be trusted, but if you look further you’d know that’s absolutely not the case. People will say, “Oh, well she knew madam pomfrey could probably fix it, so it was more of a safety measure. Once they all knew who did it it would go away.” But it’s stated that the jinx was so hard to remove it took a significant period of time and research to figure out how to get rid of it, common anti jinxes didn’t work. Hermione CLEARLY wasn’t planning for this to be a temporary punishment, she wanted it to be permanent, even took a lot of time into making sure it was permanent,and when I mean punishment I mean PUNISHMENT. She was basically planning to ruin Marietta’s life. And yes I know she wasn’t specifically targeting Marietta, but I don’t get how that makes it any better. She was still planning to use it to ruin someone’s life, whether it was Marietta or anyone else.
 
  4. It’s out of character. I’ve always thought of Hermione being a little more on the forgiving side, Marietta’s just a teenage girl who made a mistake, and instead of feeling remorseful she  instead prided herself in being able to create such a powerful jinx. Is this really the same Hermione that was so compassionate and empathetic to the house elves? Now why is she casting powerful jinxes on other people for no apparent reason except to give them a taste of sweet justice. I would’ve been completely okay with it if it served a purpose, because you have to do what you have to do, but just to feel satisfied you hurt someone that hurt you? That’s not Hermione, in my opinion, but maybe I just haven’t got a good grasp on the character. 

Overall I think it was just a tough situation, but ultimately I side with Cho Chang and think she was a little over the top. Before you downvote me I’d like to again say I don’t hate Hermione, she is one of my favorite characters actually, but in this particular instance I think she was wrong."
507,1690250483.0,HarryPotterBooks,"The four school champions - While re-reading GOF, I had a thought about Dumbledore and his treatment of Harry. 
When the goblet of fire spit out a fourth name, Dumbledore stopped and stared at it before reading it aloud. He took those few seconds to make a decision. 
If he cared about protecting Harry from public scrutiny, he could have briefly walked out and spoken with Bagman and Crouch and then informed Madam Maxime and Karkoroff of what was happening and that Harry must compete. He knew Harry did not put his own name in for the tournament. and, knowing everything Dumbledore knew about the prophecy and the signs of Voldemort’s return, he probably also deduced that someone was trying to get Harry killed by entering him.
Instead he read Harry’s name out loud and forced him to endure the public humiliation and allow the wizard of world to believe that Harry put his own name in for the sake of fame and attention. 
I just feel that if Dumbledore truly cared for Harry, he could have protected him so much more during this time. Or at least provide support. Dumbledore never even has a conversation with Harry about being entered in the triwizard tournament- he only asks Harry if he put his name in the goblet. Instead, he leaves him to face the judgement of his pupils and the public eye without any support. 
Am I wrong here? Thoughts?"

You’d think she’d want to go see her family she grew up with for 11 years, but now it’s like they don’t even have a daughter anymore. 
      Did J.K ever specify why? It didn’t seem like she had bad parents or anything. My best guess is she doesn’t like the muggle world so she tries to spend as least time as possible there"
510,1690213208.0,HarryPotterBooks,"Why wasn't Hermione in Ravenclaw? - Apologies if this has been posted before, I'm new here. I've never understood why Hermione wants out in Ravenclaw. Sure, she's brave and all that, but that doesn't really happen until later books. The sorting hat can see potential, but doesn't necessarily decide on that over current traits (IMO). At the start of the series she really is basically just a brainiac that is all about learning and being the smartest student. The only way I can see how she landed in Gryffindor over Ravenclaw is that she asked, like Harry did. But I can't fathom why she would do so as an 11 year old. Ravenclaw just seems too perfect.

Edit: thanks everyone for helping remind me of some references I missed or haven't gotten to in my latest listen through the Audiobooks! Especially thanks for the part in the chess game in PS (completely missed that) and reminders about the direct conversation in one of the later books where she was given the choice by the hat.

511,1690203704.0,HarryPotterBooks,"I believe that prior to PS Hermione was bullied - As the title suggests, I belive Hermione was bullied prior to PS.

As I haven't read the books in a while, and never in English - for English is not my native language, I will not use quotes and some sources may or may not be 100% true, therefore I welcome to correct me if I write rubish or maybe you have the right sources and maybe Quotes that proof my point. Discussion is of course welcomed.

So, I believe Hermione was bullied, why do I think that.

First of all we all know she is a Muggleborn witch, and we know almost nothing about her life in the muggle World. We know her Parents are Dentists, we know she is an only child and we can assume that she has no Friends outsite of Hogwarts. Why can we assume that? Because she rarely really speaks of her Childhood (idk if that her Father was bitten by a patient was mentioned in HBP or if that was a movie invention) or life outside the Wizarding World (WW). One could argue that is because we read the Story out of Harrys perspective, but the counter Argument is that A. Hermione is one of his best friends and B. we know somethings about Rons Childhood. That is not yet an Argument that she has no friends outside the WW, but if we reflect what Ron tells about his Childhood on to Hermione one can see a pattern. First of all, I believe Ron too has no Friends outside of Hogwarts, but he has his Siblings and tells stories about them. And he even learns the names of the two Brothers he hasn't met yet, that being Bill and Charlie, and Ginnys name even though they really first meet in CoS. If Hermione has any friends we'd read about it at least in passing.

So now we established she has no friends outside the WW. Let's look at her Childhood. Wow, there is nothing to read about. Hmmm, but we know of the Childhood of a Wizard that grew up in the Muggle World, namely Harry.

Harry lived in an abusive Household, we can assume that Hermione didn't, since what little we know about her relationship with her Parents, we know they loved each other - Hermione going back home during Winterbreak in PS, her feeling really guilty about lying to her Parents in PoA about not comming back during Winterbreak, and how hard it was for her to Obliviate her parents memory in DH. So we can ignore everything that happenend to Harry from the Dursleys (in exception of Dudley, because he has yet a part to play). That leaves his time at school, we know Dudley and his friends bullied him, and that he had no friends because everyone else was afraid of them. We know that once when Harry ran away he apparated (i believe that he apparated could've also been a huge jump) onto the school roof, and other things happened with magic protecting him (i.e. vanishing the glass at the start of PS). Magic protecting Wizard children happens oftentimes (for example Neville when he almost fell to death because his great uncle \[or who ever he was\] let him fall to certain death when he wanted to push Neville to show signs of Magic and he was distracted, or baby Neville pulling the blanket over cold bodyparts \[before his parents were tortured to insanity and while no one was looking\] \[though the last part was I believe from Pottermore\] I believe something similar was told about Ron and other Kids but I can't remember) so this could've also happened to Hermione.

So let's draw some parallels. Hermione had no Friends and Harry had no Friends. Hermione is a Witch Harry is a Wizard. Magic can and will protect Wizard Children who can't controll magic yet. Both were Children. I know not having friends and being bullied is not the same, but first let us look a bit at Hermiones Character.

Hermione is a character that reads alot and is Book smart and is kind of a know it all, she is not particularly strong at making friends (as evidence by the fact that she had no friends Prior to Hogwarts and had a hard time making friends in Hogwarts), was in PS a bit reclusive (I think she wasn't as reclusive during most of the Series but during Stresful Situations (i.e. DH) her reclusiveness came back) and was afraid of getting kicked out of school (That's why I believe she is reluctant to break Da Rules). (yeah I know a bit barebones, and not at all complete)

I believe at school pre Hogwarts she was bullied. The how I don't know, the who i can only guess - the other children - but the why is IMO obvious, because she's a Witch/ she's Diffrent. Those of us who were/are bullied, we know that all it takes is to be diffrent than others, for unfortunately the Humans and especially Children are Xenophobic. It propably started because Hermione was a bit of a know it all, and then her Magic protected her. The bullying festered her being a know it all, created her reclusiveness and inability to make friends. For her the Muggle-School was propably hell. (That's why she's so afraid to get Kicked out of Hogwarts, because she would go back to Hell.) To compensate she propably read alot and learned a lot. 

Thats why I believe Hermione was bullied before her time at Hogwarts.

tl:dr: because she's a witch"

515,1690151606.0,HarryPotterBooks,"The Power of Remorse - Recently on a post where a user asked this sub to explain what happened in the King's Cross chapter of Deathly Hallows. On my response to that post, I had a very interesting conversation with another user u/nursewithnolife who raised a fascinating question-

>I do wonder though… I imagine if someone like Grindelwald felt remorse (like it says he did), then the shattered soul within him would seal itself. If someone who created a horcrux that was still intact felt remorse, would the fragment be pulled from the horcrux to rejoin the fragment within the living body? What would happen the the horcrux itself? And then what happens in Voldy’s case? If he felt remorse at the end of the battle of Hogwarts, 7 of the fragments are already destroyed, so would he ‘regrow’ the missing parts of his soul? Would his appearance revert back to his human self?

I was intrigued by the question, and it took me some time to consider before I responded.

This is my take- 
I don't think a bit of soul can be reattached or regained at any point. Once it's been detached through that vile process it's not something one can get back. I think that showing remorse would heal the soul one still has within. We know, for example, that Voldemort's was so tattered that a bit broke off when the spell rebounded.  It was... brittle for lack of a better word, like when a piece of wood has been exposed to the elements and starts to weaken and crack.  

I think showing and feeling remorse would help heal the soul. 

But I also think it would require an act of contrition should there still be Horcruxes in existence. The remaining Horcruxes would have to be destroyed, either yourself or by someone else. I think until then, your soul couldn't become whole again. 

Even when ""healed"" I don't think that means the soul is ever *completely* whole again. I think it would require one to live a life that is meaningful and never lose that sense of remorse for their actions. 

I strongly believe that should someone who is able to heal their soul through remorse revert to their old ways it would instantly shatter their soul beyond repair.  I don't think it's something you can do more than once, and even then, especially in Voldemort's case, I think it would be a slow process that would require a lot of discipline, genuine regret, and good works.

I am curious as to the community's takes on this passage from Deathly Hallows. How do you think it works? Could someone who shows remorse reabsorb the bits of soul they cast into a Horcrux or is that bit of soul lost to them forever? How did you see this happening when you read that this possible? Looking forward to reading your responses and discussing, and thanks again to u/nursewithnolife for the thought exercise!"

I’m not talking about the dursleys, I mean the recap thing Rowling does where she recounts Harry’s life story(how he got the scar, voldermort killing his parents, how he found out he was a wizard, etc) over the first couple of pages, every single time, and in some extreme cases she dedicates a whole chapter. She also usually recounts some events from the last book
     The problem with this is it’s kind of boring and annoying for the people who started on book 1 like your supposed to and already know the story.

I understand it kind of goes against Dumbledore’s core values of love and mercy, but this is war! Some of the enemy’s top lieutenants were exposed constantly. 

Is it because the Ministry was against them initially and they were worried they would be prosecuted for their actions?

On a side note, Lucius would never have been allowed to just hang out with his family as he is described after the Battle of Hogwarts. He is a war criminal who took the lead role of Muggle torture for years. He would have been apprehended and immediately sent to Azkaban for life by the surviving Order members, if not killed outright. Harry might be the forgiving type, but it’s not really up to him.

Just some things I have been thinking about recently."
524,1689959148.0,HarryPotterBooks,"Couldn’t put the book down -      Last night I stayed up until 2 o clock in the morning, reading the entire last half of the prisoner of Azkaban(I think from the time harry gets the marauders map to the end). I’m a first time reader(seen a couple of the early films but only when I was a kid, so I don’t really remember the story.)
        I was completely blown away, the first two books were definitely good but had some flaws, but right from the start this one had me knowing what all the hype was about. It was so exciting at times I had to put the book down a couple of times and stare at the ceiling to think about how awesome it is. The scene where Harry is anxiously waiting for griffindor to lead by 50 so he can catch the snitch comes to mind, it was written so well I felt like I was there watching it. 
    Also the characters REALLY developed in this book. Before it just kinda felt like Harry was the main character, kinda brave but he was stupid not to ask dumbledore for help in Cos. Hermione was smart, Ron was just his friend. Malfoy was just the typical bully who came to make foul remarks at Harry every once in a while. But this book the characters really grew on me, hermione probably being my favorite character. I love the dynamic between her and Ron, she’s not afraid to protect Harry as well by turning in his fire bolt even if she loses her friends because of it. It was also funny(but kind of sad at the same time) watching her try to do so much, and being constantly hurt by her friends in the process(Hermione had a rough year). But when she punched malfoy in the face it solidified her as my favorite character, and malfoy as my definitely most hated character. And obviously the ending super surprising, I actually predicted something big to happen to scabbers but not THAT big . When Lupin turned into a wherewolf I was wide-eyed. It was also oddly funny, at times, especially when Snape learns Draco found Harry’s head is in hogs Meade(YOURE HEAD ISNT ALLOWED IN HOGSMEADE, NO PART OF YOURE BODY IS ALLOWED IN HOGSMEADE!)😂

first off:

>'You're saying it wrong,' Harry heard Hermione snap. 'It's Wing-gar-dium Levi-o-sa, make the ""gar"" nice and long.'

ps chapter 10

so in this scene, hermione was already the first to start an argument. she was the one being rude to ron first as she snapped at him. 

&#x200B;

and despite ron protecting her so many times, she still treated ron like shit. 

more examples:

>  
>""What?"" said Ron indignantly, having managed, finally, to swallow his food. ""I'm not allowed to ask a simple question?""

533,1689852767.0,HarryPotterBooks,"'Be brave like my mother, Professor' - I have always loved the Harry-Slughorn scene in the books where Harry ~~coerces~~ pushes  Slughorn into giving him the vital Horcrux memory, because of how strongly it parallels Tom Riddle. The quality of willingness to do whatever it takes for a larger goal.

The scene begins with Hagrid and Slughorn singing drunken songs, and Harry refilling the drink in the background (already paralleling Tom who got Hagrid to fess up Fluffy information in a bar). That already adds a coercive quality to the scene, given that Felix felicis also assures Harry that Slughorn won't remember handing over this memory tomorrow.

>Anyway, in my recent re-read, I picked up something I hadn't realised before:  
>  
>“No — well, I was only one when they died,” said Harry, his eyes on the flame of the candle flickering in Hagrid’s heavy snores. “But I’ve found out pretty much what happened since. My dad died first. Did you know that?”  
>  
>“I — I didn’t,” said Slughorn in a hushed voice.  
>  
>“Yeah . . . **Voldemort murdered him and then stepped over his body toward my mum**,” said Harry.

I have highlighted a line that Harry can't have known until the next book - until he actually *sees* his parents' murder through Voldemort's eyes.  Until now, this is the information he has:

**James' death:**

>Then came a new voice, a man’s voice, shouting, panicking — “Lily, take Harry and go, It’s him, Go! Run, I’ll hold him off\~ The sounds of someone stumbling from a room — a door bursting open — a cackle of high-pitched laughter

**Lily's death:**

>“Not Harry, not Harry, please not Harry,”  
>  
>“ Stand aside, you silly girl ... stand aside, now. ...”  
>  
>“ Stand aside, you silly girl ... stand aside, now. ...”  
>  
>“ Not Harry, please no, take me, kill me instead — ”

And of course, Voldemort's taunts in Philosopher's Stone, which he will reference. The detail about Voldemort stepping over his father's body towards his mum is constructed - something he may have imagined while replaying their last moments in his head in POA (which he is said to have done), and he particularly uses this line, of Voldemort casually degrading his father's body by stepping over it to really push Slughorn's buttons, to horrify him.

Respectability is important to Slughorn, and he will emotionally respond to callous details like this. Harry understands this, given what he observes about Slughorn over the course of this book.

And then Harry tells Slughorn what Voldemort said in Philosopher's Stone:

>Slughorn gave a great shudder, but he did not seem able to tear his horrified gaze away from Harry’s face.  
>  
>“He told her to get out of the way,” said Harry remorselessly. “He told me she needn’t have died. He only wanted me. She could have run.”  
>  
>“Oh dear,” breathed Slughorn. “She could have ... she needn’t ... That’s awful. ...”

**This is what Voldemort says:**

>but your mother needn’t have died ... she was trying to protect you. ... Now give me the Stone, unless you want her to have died in vain.”

Interesting how Harry uses a similar tactic on Slughorn later in the scene: ""give me the memory or she would have died in vain"".

Anyway, back to the scene. To make the scene even more horrifying for Slughorn, Harry infers Lily's motivations from what he has heard from his parents' last moments and says it to induce more horror (and guilt):

>“It is, isn’t it?” said Harry, in a voice barely more than a whisper. “But she didn’t move. Dad was already dead, but she didn’t want me to go too. She tried to plead with Voldemort ... but he just laughed. ...”

The idea that Harry replayed his parents' death over and over again back when he first heard their deaths, imagined their motivation, constructed a scene for himself is extremely sad. This is how he talks about it in POA:

>D’you know what I see and hear every time a dementor gets too near me?” Ron and Hermione shook their heads, looking apprehensive. “I can hear my mum screaming and pleading with Voldemort.And if you’d heard your mum screaming like that, just about to be killed, you wouldn’t forget it in a hurry. And if you found out someone who was supposed to be a friend of hers betrayed her and sent Voldemort after her — ”  
  
>  
>“There’s nothing you can do!” said Hermione, looking stricken.

But the fact that he then uses something that is obviously a horrifying and personal memory against Slughorn is absolutely chilling.

Anyway, here is Harry taking the leaf out of Voldemort's book:

>""But you won’t help her son,” said Harry. **“She gave me her life, but you won’t give me a memory**.”Harry looked steadily into Slughorn’s tear-filled eyes. The Potions master seemed unable to look away.

After which, Harry takes ownership of being the 'Chosen One' out loud to another person. That is, of course, important in context of next chapter because it also deals with statement and interrogates it.

It is only at the end of the scene that Harry offers mercy for Slughorn's guilt: ""You'd cancel out anything you did by giving me that memory. It would be a very brave and noble thing to do."""

Unpopular opinion? I’m glad he LEFT the Hunt. That camping trip was the most boring, dull, stupid, and useless part of a fictional war I’ve ever read. Ron single-handedly saved it when came back.  
  
So, why am I glad he left the tent?  
  
It got him away from the Horcrux that had been torturing him for months. It got him away from something that turned his self-loathing and insecurities into suicidal ideations. The Locket weaponized Ron’s depression and anxiety against him in horrible ways and I’m surprised he lasted as long as he did before snapping and walking away from it. People that look at Ron here and think he’s weak and cowardly are just downright fooling themselves if they honestly believe they’d do any better than Ron did. I mean, he was 17 and people still act as if Ron leaving Harry and Hermione here was some type of unforgivable war crime or that it’d make him the next Pettigrew. It’s disgusting. Revolting. Makes me glad I don’t associate with anyone like them in my real life.  
He needed to get his Splinching wound healed properly. Dittany wasn’t enough. He needed blood-replenishing potions and pain relief potions. He needed real rest and food to recover.

  
He was right about the mission not going well. They were in over their heads. Camping was getting them nowhere. Harry even said their biggest accomplishment was not being dead yet. People were dying as they were hiding. Not finding more Horcruxes or ways to destroy the one they had was disheartening for all of them. They were stuck, but Harry had refused all help so far and Ron knew he’d keep refusing. So, yes, Ron was frustrated with the way Harry was “leading” them and he had a right to be. Why does nobody ever mention that Hermione agrees with Ron, but she was too afraid to ever say it out loud to Harry? Instead, she threw Ron under the bus trying to save herself. People hate Ron because he’s never been afraid to call out Harry and Hermione. He doesn’t lick their boots or blindly follow them and people HATE him for that. How dare this super average nobody named Ron ever dare to tell Harry The Hero and Hermione The Goddess they’re wrong or that their ideas aren’t working?!  
Ron was trying to see if Harry saw anything related to his family in the visions he got from Voldemort. We saw how worried Ron was about his family after the Death Eaters attacked Bill and Fleur’s wedding. We also saw just how physically relieved he was at getting his dad’s Patronus. It was never going to be easy for Ron to go with Harry and Hermione on the run knowing he left his family behind in the world where Voldemort was in control, especially once they had no way of ever knowing anything after Grimmauld Place.  
Why would Ron be worried about his family?

  
Let’s see: Arthur, Molly, Bill, Fleur, Charlie, Fred, and George are all Order of the Phoenix members. They could be out fighting Death Eaters or on other missions. Arthur almost got killed by Nagini, Bill was mauled by Greyback, and George had permanently lost an ear all while working for the Order. Ron probably knew his Uncles Fabian and Gideon were brutally murdered by five Death Eaters during Vold War I while working for the Order. That’s not a great track record if you ask me.  
Arthur and Percy (I know he was estranged still, but I don’t care because I know that the Weasleys all loved and cared for each other, even if it was in their own fucked up and deep down ways) worked at the Voldemort controlled Ministry of Magic.  
Bill, Fred, and George all continued to work in Diagon Alley during this time.  
Ginny was at Death Eater infested Hogwarts because it was mandatory for pure-blood and half-blood children of age to attend. Remember, at that time, the Trio still believed Snape had murdered Dumbledore in cold-blood.  
Speaking of mandatory attendance at Hogwarts, Ron had to Transfigure the family Ghoul to look like him with a terrible case of Spattergroit to trick the Ministry into believing he was too contagious to attend. Do you know what that likely meant? If Ron was caught with Harry, Ron’s family getting murdered would be his punishment - his fault. That is the lives of NINE (Fleur included) people Ron risked by going with Harry. So, yeah, Harry and Hermione WERE alright in this area. They were free to focus on the mission without the added stress and worry of family and Ron didn’t. Ron put his ENTIRE FUCKING FAMILY on the line for Harry here and people still have the motherfucking audacity to call him disloyal?!? To say he didn’t sacrifice anything?!? Yikes. Couldn’t ever be me.

  
What was the first news Ron got about his family after they went on the camping trip?  
The Trio overheard a conversation between two Goblins, Ted Tonks, Dirk Cresswell, and Dean Thomas. It’s mentioned by the Goblins that three Hogwarts students (Ginny, Neville, and Luna) attempted to steal the Sword of Gryffindor from the Headmaster’s Office. They later learn that Ginny, Neville, and Luna were sent to Hagrid for punishment. Look, we as readers all know that Hagrid was a better punishment than the Carrows, but we have to remember the Trio didn’t know what was going on Hogwarts exactly. And like I mentioned earlier, the Horcrux amplified any negative emotion Ron had and that included paranoia. Ron knows what’s in the Forbidden Forest. Giant man-eating Acromantulas, Centaurs that are angry at wizards, a giant, etc.. He knows there have been Dementors and werewolves and even Voldemort once. It terrified him to think of his baby sister going there for good reason!

  
But what really drove Ron’s worry about his family into overdrive and what made the desire to check on his family an obsession that needed itched was this line: “”They’re okay, though?” asked Ted quickly. “I mean, the Weasleys don’t need any more of their kids injured, do they?”” And when Ron told Harry and Hermione his fears about that line, Harry threw the Orphan Card in Ron’s face and is told for a third time to leave. And people are surprised that he actually left after that? Really? Harry tried to guilt trip and manipulate Ron there. But it didn’t work because Ron’s loyalty to his family finally jumped ahead of the loyalty to his friends. And that’s okay! Ron was 17; he was a young human in an impossible situation with no clear direction. What people don’t understand is that there was no winning for Ron here. None. The Horcrux helped make things be friends verse family for him. He did the best he could. And you know what? Ron may have left at first, but he wanted to come back right away. Somehow, that means nothing to a lot of people. Guess they’ve never done or said something they regret in the middle of a terrible fight (and none of them have the excuse of being in the middle of a fucking war). I don’t even think Ron should regret leaving because if Hermione’s shield was anything to go by, walking away was better than throwing curses. They all needed some space from each other and Ron needed distance from the Horcrux. Extenuating circumstances didn’t care, though, and the Snatchers prevented Ron’s immediate return.

  
Harry was being downright awful to Ron during the fight and he didn’t have the Horcrux on at the time. Now, one might argue that he was still feeling affects from it, so he wasn’t himself, either. To that, I’d say, you better fucking give Ron that some leniency, but even more since he was wearing the damn thing. Harry I-don’t-want-excuses-made-for-him Potter would NOT allow Ron to remove it after Hermione insisted. Harry mocked Ron’s mother at least two or three times. He kept bringing up comfort as if Ron wasn’t severely injured. He was unwilling to admit they were getting nowhere and needed to think of a new plan. All he did was invalidate every single worry Ron had and then he threw out the Orphan Card. Ron brought Harry into his family. He shared his home and family with Harry. Can you imagine how Ron felt hearing Harry so callously dismiss his very valid fears just because his parents are dead?! ANYBODY would have needed space to cool down after that without a demonic necklace involved, but people crucify and vilify and say Ron should have fucking died all because he left after Harry told him to leave three times. But I’m just saying that if you don’t blame Harry for the fight or his role in Ron leaving and you place all the blame on Ron, you’re very biased and hypocritical and probably just your run of the mill Ron basher - they’re a dime a dozen, you know? Maybe try giving empathy to Ron - or understand where he’s coming from. It’s not hard. People always care about mental health and trauma about every character EXCEPT for Ron. The standards Ron are held to are unfathomable and unrealistic and I’m so glad he doesn’t meet them because then he wouldn’t the Ron I love and admire so much.

  
Ron leaving showed how badly Harry and Hermione needed Ron. How much they missed him. Hermione spent weeks crying for him. Harry had never felt more hopeless in his life. They even resorted to taking out a portrait to have company because they didn’t talk to each other much. Like, it got better towards the end right before Godric’s Hollow, but Harry’s broken wand took them back to almost silence. There was no dancing or “charged moments” like JKR supposedly said existed (and if she was actually serious about that and not just pandering to the Harmony fans, well, that’s just even more proof that she sucks at romance, LMAO).  
How did Ron save the camping trip with his return?  
  
Ron dived into that frozen lake twice - he saved Harry’s life and then he went back for the Sword of Gryffindor.  
He destroyed the Locket - his torturer. His worst thoughts and deepest fears were exposed in front of his best friend and that had to make it hurt worse. Just look at the way he cried his heart out afterwards. But we got that lovely little “I love her like a sister” bit and the one and only hug between Ron and Harry after it all, so I can’t be too mad.  
Ron’s remorse and regret are palpable. He apologized with a thick and croaky voice after crying. He made no excuses when he had plenty of them. He shouldered ALL the blame when it wasn’t all his to carry.

  
Shrugged off all Harry said about saving him and destroying the Horcrux making up for it. Ron’s humility is heartbreaking and devastatingly beautiful at times and this showed that.  
Gave Harry his hope back.  
When he fought off the five Snatchers, he escaped with a wand or two of theirs. Guess who needed a wand after the disastrous Godric’s Hollow trip? Harry.  
He brought back a wireless radio, so they could listen to Potterwatch and stay better connected to what’s happening.

  
He was able to learn for a fact that his family was still okay. Talk about a morale booster!  
He brought back confirmation of the Taboo on Voldemort’s name that he had already suspected existed.  
He was able to get his Splinched shoulder properly fixed and was left with yet another gnarly scar (I’m horrible, but I loveeeee Ron’s brain scars and the Splinching one just makes it better). He got pain relief and blood replenished. He didn’t need a sling anymore. No more feelings of uselessness to fight with this healed!  
Seeing as we never really hear the Trio complain about being hungry after Ron’s return, I think it’s safe to assume he brought food with him. Harry mentioned Ron’s rucksack was full when he grabbed it.  
Let’s be real: Harry’s two or three month long obsession over the Deathly Hallows would have been way worse without Ron. Way worse. Ron was very encouraging and he lead the Trio around during this time. His time away rejuvenated his spirit and strengthened his mind and he was able to help Harry and Hermione do that when he came back.  
Oh, and Ron leaving and coming back allowed him to think of Shell Cottage quickly when they needed a place for Dobby to take everyone trapped in Malfoy Manor.  
JKR once made a comment about how Hermione was the one who stayed with Harry throughout the whole last book and how that said something powerful about her while Ron leaving said something powerful about him. But it’s like… her writing reflected the complete opposite of that. Hermione might have stayed with Harry, but the only things they accomplished was almost getting themselves killed, breaking Harry’s wand, and finding and trusting a book written by Rita Skeeter. So, if Hermione staying with Harry the whole time was supposed to be something big, why the fuck did she write what she did? 😂🤷‍♀️  
  
I’m just saying it’s kind of funny that she made Ron get a whole lot of shit done on his own away from the other two while it was the complete opposite for Harry and Hermione with him gone. Why would she do that? Was that to show that Ron limits himself around them to avoid bruising their fragile egos? That he was being dragged down and he needed to find himself away from the shadows of his best friends? I don’t know what she was aiming for, so I think it’s safe to say she missed the mark.  
  
Ron left the tent a horrible, broken, beaten down mess, but he came back 10 times stronger and better than ever."

2. harry potter and the soceror's stone- in this book, harry and his friends learn how to perform magic.
3. harry potter and the goblet of fire- there are many events and triwizard tornaments in this book. i find them exciting.
4. harry potter and the prisoner of azkaban- in this book, ron and hermione keeps arguing about crookshanks and scambbers. 
5. harry potter and the chamber of secrets- i disliked hagrid a lot in this book, i had to admit, because he brought a dangerous, ugly monster to school. thankfully the monster was dead in hbp.
6. harry potter and the half blood prince- this is the book when dumbledore dies. 
7. harry potter and the order of the phoenix- ok, so this the worst harry potter book and i really feel so sad for harry or sirius. harry spends a lot of time crying and yelling in this book. nearly no one believed him that voldemort was back and the ministry was against him and dumbledore for one whole year. can you imagine harry being accused for one whole year and having to suffer a lot?? also, sirius died in this book."

We know he returns the EW to Dumbledore's tomb. 

What do you think he does with Draco's wand? Seems like such an odd thing to have in his possession, he can't return it because the wand has changed allegiance, but he doesn't need it. Does he keep it as a spare? Give it to one of the kids?

Hence, for like the first 10 years of his life he was just hanging out with his parents, their lackey friends, then sometimes playing with children his age. In the first two books he's quoting things his father likely said e.g shit talking Hagrid and Hufflepuff, talking about the 'other kind', saying Authur Weasley should just snap his wand and go join the muggles, etc. He was gleeful over the thought of Hermione getting killed and saying racist stuff, then delighting in the fear and misery around the school.

In later books he tries to immediately humiliate the trio especially Ron over the article before getting turned into a ferret, made the Potter Stinks badges. When he becomes a prefect he immediately tries to hold it above Harry's head then when playing Quittich and losing he got angry basically saying 'Your mother' to the Weasleys and Harry. Afterwards Lucius gets arrested where it's like he didn't even know what to do and was in shock that Harry managed to get him arrested when confronting him on the train. He was even saying something along the lines of 'you can't send my father to prison'.

His main friends were dumb as hell with limited emotions so they weren't exactly known for their deep conversations, idk what Pansy's deal was with him. I'm not even sure if he was popular among the Slytherin House."

I think she is right to warn Harry about Umbridge and how potentially dangerous it could be to get on the wrong side of her and therefore he needs to check his temper. 

 I think she feels sorry for Harry and frustrated at the position Umbridge has left them all in. The only thing is I think Harry at this stage could do with some adult saying I understand this is frustrating for you as I think he just feels so misunderstood and isolated from some of the adults in his life. Dumbledore I think would have warned him and told him to cautious but might have also said that. They both deeply care about him and I like the relationship he has with both of them but I think an interesting thing Harry says is McGonagall didn’t invite confidence in the same way Dumbledore did.

It hits so hard on rereads, because that is what Dumbledore had always so painstakingly tried to teach Tom Riddle, but he was too obsessed with avoiding death to live a life to the fullest.

The Prince's Tale, the Forest Again, and King's Cross are the climax of the book series and the three best consecutive chapters ever written.  There is so much emotion, the mysteries of the last three books are neatly wrapped up and in the middle, as Harry is facing Voldemort, his last thought is of Ginny. I'm always a mess by the time we get to Dumbledore and his confession that Harry is the better man. It's so fucking good

My thought is Crouch Jr was originally supposed to kill him but decided imprisoning Moody would be better for the plan, it seems weird they were planning to kill Moody at all.

House elves can apparate pretty much anywhere if their master asks them to. >!In Chamber of Secrets, dobby apparates inside Hogwarts multiple times !<so any house elf can apparate into Hogwarts ie they don't need to be employed at Hogwarts to apparate inside the castle.

Q1. Why do people prefer the time taking and unreliable method of owling heavy items to students at Hogwarts when they could just send a house elf and be done with it in a minute (considering they own a house elf, otherwise owling stuff is understandable)? I'm assuming that there might be some type of Hogwarts rule against it or smt and therefore parents avoid doing that, they might occasionally do it but it's against the rules so that makes sense.

Q2. >!Why didn't the death eaters just enter Hogwarts in book 6 using house elves? Why the elaborate, difficult, risky method of vanishing cabinets? Why don't prisoners, who own house elves, let's assume the captured death eaters in book 6, use house elves to break out of prison? Can people break out of Azkaban using house elves?

When I read the end of *Order of the Phoenix*, it wasn’t clear to me that Sirius was for sure, definitely dead. Pushed through a curtain? Big deal! I thought, since we didn’t observe a corpse, there would be some zaney teleportation workaround that would allow Sirius to appear in the next book, to his friend’s  surprise and applause. So his death didn’t hit me until a year later, when the next book debuted.

563,1689340368.0,HarryPotterBooks,"Who do you think is better, Remus Lupin or Sirius Black? - Remus is
- the kindest Marauder
- the moral compass
- the best DADA teacher Harry’s year ever had (by their own account)
- wants to be close to Harry (he’s the one who initiates their first office conversation when Harry misses the first Hogsmeade trip)
- funny
- compassionate

He is also
- emotionally unavailable. He only gets close to Harry in POA because Harry insists on private lessons to fight dementors. He abandons Tonks when they are in love by going and living with werewolves. He tries to abandon her and their child by joining Harry’s quest.

- unresponsive to Harry’s need for family. In POA, as far as he knows, he is the only living uncorrupted Marauder but shares no stories about Harry’s dad. He never writes Harry his entire childhood, and after POA disappears into OOTP, and after OOTP Harry hopes he’ll write after Sirius’ death but he doesn’t 

- Abandons his own father; after his mother dies, he is his father’s only remaining family, but he decides that he is a burden and refuses to stay with his father after he graduates Hogwarts

- Willing to kill his traitorous former friend in cold blood. If they had shown a modicum of mercy, would Peter have returned to the Dark Lord, who says “you are only here because you have nowhere else to go”?

- Loyalty to friends to the point of betrayal of values. The worst thing Remus ever did, IMO, was not telling Dumbledore about the unguarded secret passageways to Hogsmeade even AFTER traitor, murderer, and former best friend Sirius Black was found in his favorite student, mentee, and other best friend’s dormitory wielding a freaking knife. The Animagi thing, fine, he was too ashamed, but the secret passageways?? That was definitely how Sirius was getting in and out, whether as a dog or person. I can’t help but think that there was a part of Remus who was just more loyal to Sirius than to Dumbledore. [As an aside, my headcanon is that Dumbledore brought Remus to Hogwarts that year because he expected Black to seek him out and try to recruit him. Remus had been alone and ostracized for over a decade, he was a dark creature, and would have been very vulnerable to such a visit. Dumbledore provided Wolfsbane, community, a close eye, memories of how Dumbledore helped him by letting him into Hogwarts, and, most importantly, allowed him to get close to James’ lookalike son, which resulted in Remus being tormented by vicariously remembering the night James died over and over, knowing it was Sirius’ fault]. 

Sirius is: 
- Most bound by the demands of honor, including the obligation to “fulfill his duties as godfather” even if it meant living on rats in a cave
- Emotionally available as a father figure to Harry even though he spent 12 years getting the happiness sucked out of him
- A magical genius in his day
- maybe the funniest Marauder 
- Very caring and loyal to those he cares about. He lets Harry vent about Ron for 30 min in GOF when it’s more urgent to talk about the tournament and Voldemort, all while risking his soul by breaking into a house and using their fireplace, kneeling uncomfortably on their floor the whole time. He leaves his sunny hideaway to be physically close to Harry in GOF and as a result is able to be there for him after he escapes Voldemort
- Shared food with Buckbeak even when he was starving (they both ate rats)
- Loved James the most

He is also

- Reckless
- Unkind to those he dislikes
- Remorseless for his bullying of Snape 
- When at his worst, a part of him may want Harry expelled so he won’t be alone any more
- Slightly unhinged by his long stay in Azkaban (I hate even listing this as a flaw though because come on, most people go totally mad or stop eating and die) 
- Wasn’t a good brother to Regulus, likely due to jealousy and the golden child/scapegoat dynamics that characterize families led by a narcissist. He also hated his mother forever, rather than feeling conflicted about where things went wrong, and in JKR’s world hating your mother is a big no-no. 
-Treated Kreacher poorly
-Was willing to kill his traitorous former friend in cold blood
- Didn’t trust authority figures, even Dumbledore, enough. If he had gone straight to Dumbledore from Azkaban in POA and presented himself as Snape did when he was an active Death Eater, explained the whole thing, Dumbledore could have summoned Ron, captured Pettigrew, cleared Sirius, and prevented the return of Voldemort.

Thank you for all the advice on my previous post about the Graveyard scene. I ended up reading it as written and showed the Jim Kay pictures. I asked throughout if they were ok continuing/if it was too much and they said they were “loving it.” 

But now that we’ve finished GoF, they’re already begging to start OoTP. Is it too early? I got some great feedback in my last post and I’ve told them I need to think about it.

Would love to hear if anyone has read it themselves or read to their little one at similar ages.

Thank you!

When he gets to Avada Kedavra and mentions that Harry is the only person to have survived it, I had a thought.

We know that Lily’s love for Harry is what protected him, love is a magic Voldemort can’t understand, blah blah blah, all that makes sense. But, is Harry seriously the only person who has been saved from the killing curse because of this protection is love? Is Lily protecting Harry the ONLY TIME someone has sacrificed themselves out of love to protect someone? Or was Lily Potter one of the most powerful witches of all time that only she could’ve conjured that sort of protection magic.

It seems like the protection that Lily gave Harry should’ve been applied to all the other families Voldemort had killed, what made Lily’s love for Harry so powerful that Harry is the ONLY person who has survived the killing curse?"

Dumbledore doesn’t take it personally and also is attuned to Harry’s feelings based on his own painful experiences. He sees Harry is hurting and reached his breaking point and needs to get this out

Speaking about me, I had already read all the Harry Potter books multiple times before I watched the movies (and disliked them thoroughly). And it was much, much later when I came across fanfiction and public opinion forums like this subreddit. So I already had pretty strong opinions of the characters that weren't influenced by any external sources. And still, my opinions changed regarding quite a few characters:

1. Ron became my favourite character after seeing so much hatred for him. Yeah, ironical, but I guess decent amount of people will relate to me. 

2. I went from being a massive fan of Snape as a person to being a massive fan of Snape as a character. External opinions made me look beyond his ""ultimate sacrifice and love for Lily"", and made me realise I whitewashing him in my head during re-reads. 

3. I understood that Dumbledore is less white and more light grey, and that makes me both love and hate him a bit more. 

4. Draco Malfoy became an important character in my head. No, my opinion regarding him is still the same, but the amount of importance he gets in the fandom compared to his plot relevance astonishes me no end. 

5. The universal hate for Umbridge surprises me a bit. To me, she was always a comical villain who I knew was going to be *trolled* at the end. So I never gave her enough importance to truly hate her. (The character I hate the most is Pettigrew)

6. My opinion regarding other characters didn't change much, but I just want to say- Hermione is amazing, yeah, *but she's not a goddess*"

Since then wizards remained the same while muggles developed advanced military technology that is more productive than yelling avada kedabra. Now I know it doesn't need to be perfectly logical, what I fail to understand is how someone like Dumbledore of Voldemort, who are well versed in the muggle world, could think it would ever work.

It just is so disappointing to discourage active discussion in this sub. We all love Harry Potter and active discussions are what we all want. It big downer to see people constantly at each others throats in posts. 

In Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince Harry Potter and Albus Dumbledore delve into the Pensieve to explore a series of memories of that Dumbledore has collected of Voldemort's past. Dumbledore and Harry are sometimes following behind a character in the memory.

 The characters have knocked on the door and were allowed inside by others in the memory. But how do Harry and Dumbledore manage to follow along without being barred by the closing door? 

Does the pensieve just allow Harry and Dumbledore to enter into the next portion of the memory as well? It is hard to imagine what that would look like though. Would the door just be open longer for them to proceed or they could enter through the door and the characters wouldn't notice. J.K. didn't specify. 

What are your thoughts on what that would look like? I think that the person answering the door just allows everyone in the memory to enter. I sometimes get anxiety when I get to those parts because I don't want Harry and Dumbledore to be excluded from the memory."

Throughout history, propaganda has been widely used by dictators to sway the general population to their way of thinking. 

Hitler used Goebbles who was essential in creating fear and paranoia in Nazi Germany.

With skeeter, voldermort would have been able to create that same sense of fear through her writing.

In Philospher’s Stone, it begins with following Mr. Dursley on a Tuesday morning. He heads to work and sees Professor McGonagall as a cat on the driveway. He sees scores of people out celebrating in cloaks, hears people talking about Harry and the Potters, etc.
That night, readers meet McGonagall and Dumbledore. McGonagall asks Dumbledore to confirm the rumors swirling. Hagrid arrives with Harry, you know the story.
In DH, the scene is solidified when the readers and Harry see the murder of the Potters from Voldemort’s POV, where he murdered them at night on Halloween (Monday). 
I suppose I’m confused on the timeline after. Hagrid, when he arrives, says “house was almost destroyed, but I got him out all right before the Muggles started swarmin’ around. He fell asleep as we was flyin’ over Bristol.” Later we learn that Sirius was first on the scene, then goes to find Pettigrew. 
How long did Harry sit unattended before he was discovered? Hagrid makes it sound fairly quick but there’s almost an entire 24 hours that passes between Harry’s survival and his landing at the Dursley’s. I feel like this gap probably only bothers me.

617,1688552822.0,HarryPotterBooks,Cowardice or what Harry perceives to be cowardice is something he really has no tolerance for - When he is enraged with Snape and Lupin in different circumstances he calls them both cowards and you can feel the contempt and scorn when he says it. He does later feel bad and remorseful about calling Lupin this and later calls Snape the bravest man he knew. This I think goes along with his Gryffindor side and fierce bravery. I can’t even imagine how he would react if someone called him a coward. I wonder if Sirius’s enraged reaction to when Snape taunts him for being at home is similar as they both are very brave and dislike inaction ( I don’t even think Snape thinks Sirius is a coward despite his dislike and contempt of him but he knows it is a way of getting under Sirius’s skin). When Slughorn mentions not wanting to return to Hogwarts because of the proximity to the order of the Pheonix again Harry is initially quite scornful about that especially as it makes him of think of Sirius’s time hiding and how Sirius braved rats to be near Harry

So in a bid to sort fanfiction from Pottermore canon I hadn’t kept up with, I reread the whole plot of CC and became annoyed all over again that Voldemort having a child is now canon.

It’s just SO against the character that was built for him. He had no attachments, so he would have romantic or >!sexual!< (censored for NSFW) feelings? For Bellatrix or anyone else? He considered himself the epitome of superiority, and intended immortality for himself, so why would he plan an heir?

Then the people in Little Hangleton said “war turned him funny” implying that he was enlisted for WW2. The timeline also makes sense- 50 years before Harry’s 5th year was 1945, the end of the war. So Frank was just anywhere from 2-6 years younger when he enlisted, around 20-22. And he got injured with his leg and ear during the war, that he never recovered from (not to mention the PTSD).

So poor Frank lived in Little Hangleton his whole life after the war, injured, taking care of the Riddle House, since a very young age, only to die forgotten and thought of as a murderer

>“But she took you,” Dumbledore cut across him. “She may have taken you grudgingly, furiously, unwillingly, bitterly, yet still she took you, and in doing so, she sealed the charm I placed upon you. Your mother’s sacrifice made the bond of blood the strongest shield I could give you.”

>“I still don’t —”

>“While you can still call home the place where your mother’s blood dwells, there you cannot be touched or harmed by Voldemort. He shed her blood, but it lives on in you and her sister. Her blood became your refuge. You need return there only once a year, but as long as you can still call it home, there he cannot hurt you. Your aunt knows this. I explained what I had done in the letter I left, with you, on her doorstep. She knows that allowing you houseroom may well have kept you alive for the past fifteen years.”

And of course, when Dumbledore reminds Petunia ""REMEMBER MY LAST"" via Howler at the beginning of the book, Petunia does not allow Vernon to chuck Harry out, and insists that Harry is to stay at Privet Drive. She remembers that she essentially signed a magical contract by taking Harry in, and that breaking that contract may result in Harry's death.

We hear Aunt Marge say in POA that it was good of Vernon and Petunia to take Harry in, that if Harry had been left on her doorstep it would have been straight to an orphanage. So, why didn't Petunia send Harry off to an orphanage? She HATED Lily and everything she represented. Sure, some of it was jealousy, some of it was anger toward the family's Golden Child. Why agree to take in and raise her son, then?

Optimistically, perhaps Petunia DID care, at least a little bit. She might have hated Lily, but she didn't want her to *die*. And she might have hated Harry by extension, but she didn't want him to die, either. I imagine that Dumbledore's letter said something to the effect of ""your sister has been murdered, your nephew is alive, but there's a very good chance he'll be murdered too unless you agree to take him in.""   

What I don't know is if there was any suggestion made by Dumbledore that Petunia simply being Lily's sister might put her in danger as well, as Voldemort's followers might torture her for information about Harry or the Potters. \[Indeed, I imagine that the Death Eaters might have come looking for Lily Potter's living sister, as she would have been a likely candidate for custody of Harry and/or information.\] Now if THIS was the case, then Petunia's decision would be more about saving her own skin. If she thought taking Harry in and signing this magical contract equated to protection for all of them, that would be something very different.

What do you think? Did Petunia care a smidgen, or was it more about self-preservation?"

634,1688407608.0,HarryPotterBooks,"how harry survived the killing curse in the forrest - The short version is that voldemort killed his own soul

The long version is this, we learn a lot about souls and hourcruxes during DH, some of the stuf we learn is that physical damage to a human would not harm the soul but for a hourcrux the item protects the soul so damage to the item would damage/destroy the soul. This is how the hourcruxes are destroyed. Now, what is currious is, if we look at how the avada kadaver spell works. It kills someone but doesn't leave a physical mark. Almost like only there soul had been killed. This is why muggles can't tell how they die, they can't detect the soul.

I belive when he entered the clearing voldemort killed his own soul, leaving harry's unhurt. This is why he had a reaction after he attaked harry. He was feeling his own soul being killed. this is why harry didn't die.

Some might question why those given the dementors kiss didn't die. This is becuse there soul isn't killed, its taken by the dementors and traped within them for eternaty, ""a fate worse than death.""

Some people think he survived becuse he was master of death with all 3 deathly hallows. problem is, he droped the reserection stone directly before this. Relinquishing his status as master of it.

This is just a theory but i feel it is posible, dare i say probable."
635,1688388496.0,HarryPotterBooks,"Goblet of Fire is Sirius’ best book, this despite playing a relatively minor role compared to that of PoA and OotP - Harry’s point of view  in *Goblet of Fire* opens with him awaking from a vivid dream of Voldemort. He runs through a list of people he should write to, Hermione, Dumbledore, Ron, even Mr. Weasley, dismissing each one in turn. Then he thinks of Sirius:

> *Harry kneaded his forehead with his knuckles. What he really wanted (and it felt almost shameful to admit it to himself) was someone like — someone like a parent: an adult wizard whose advice he could ask without feeling stupid, someone who cared about him, who had had experience with Dark Magic. . . .* 

> *And then the solution came to him. It was so simple, and so obvious, that he couldn’t believe it had taken so long — Sirius.*

Sirius is a new figure in Harry’s life, but already his godfather has been showing his great care and attention for Harry:

> *Sirius’s letters, which were now hidden beneath the highly useful loose floorboard under Harry’s bed, sounded cheerful, and in both of them he had reminded Harry to call on him if ever Harry needed to. Well, he needed to now, all right. . . .*

So he writes to Sirius.

On his birthday, Harry receives a “superb” birthday cake from Sirius. 

After receiving Harry’s letter, he flies north “immediately” from his tropical hideout, which Harry tries to discourage, believing it to be dangerous.

Sirius risks his own head visiting Harry in the Gryffindor common room, and, despite being on the run, he is positively glowing:

> *Harry looked back into the flames, and jumped.* 

> *Sirius’s head was sitting in the fire. If Harry hadn’t seen Mr. Diggory do exactly this back in the Weasleys’ kitchen, it would have scared him out of his wits. Instead, his face breaking into the first smile he had worn for days, he scrambled out of his chair, crouched down by the hearth, and said, “Sirius — how’re you doing?”* 

> *Sirius looked different from Harry’s memory of him. When they had said good-bye, Sirius’s face had been gaunt and sunken, surrounded by a quantity of long, black, matted hair — but the hair was short and clean now, Sirius’s face was fuller, and he looked younger, much more like the only photograph Harry had of him, which had been taken at the Potters’ wedding.*

Life as a fugitive has been a shot in the arm for Sirius, who now has freedom and a renewed purpose to protect James’ son. Compare with the previous book, which has vengeance against Peter as his primary motivation (remember how he bares a large knife into Harry’s dorm, looking to kill an old friend in front of teenagers?), and with the fifth book, which features a restless Sirius, cooped up in his hated family home and feeling unable to help. 

I love this simple characterization of Sirius in the cave outside Hogsmeade:

>*“Did Crouch try and get his son off?” Hermione whispered.* 

> *Sirius let out a laugh that was much more like a bark.*

Holed up in the cave and so close to Hogwarts, Sirius becomes lean and hungry again. Harry has a poignant feeling of kinship:

> *He made a point of sending regular food packages up to the cave in the mountain for Sirius; after last summer, Harry had not forgotten what it felt like to be continually hungry.*

Sirius' care for Harry continues, and his letters become “daily” as he prepares for the Third Task. 

The shining moment for Sirius in *Goblet of Fire* is being Harry’s advocate and confidant in the aftermath of the graveyard:

> *“I need to know what happened after you touched the Portkey in the maze, Harry,” said Dumbledore.* 

> *“We can leave that till morning, can’t we, Dumbledore?” said Sirius harshly. He had put a hand on Harry’s shoulder. “Let him have a sleep. Let him rest.”* 

> *Harry felt a rush of gratitude toward Sirius, but Dumbledore took no notice of Sirius’s words. He leaned forward toward Harry. Very unwillingly, Harry raised his head and looked into those blue eyes.*

Each book in the series has a Harry-Dumbledore wrap-up talk, Sirius is the only other character who remains present through one. Sirius grows to mean so much to Harry in so short a time, which sets up the great tragedy of the fifth book. I think *Goblet of Fire* is his best feature, despite playing a larger plot role in *Prisoner* and *Order*. In those books his behavior has a touch more ambiguity - he roughs Ron up in the third book and mistreats Kreacher in the fifth - but in *Goblet* his portrayal is overwhelmingly positive."
636,1688383691.0,HarryPotterBooks,"Why was fantastic beasts on Harrys book list? - In Harrys fiat year the book list is the following:    
The Standard Book of Spells, Grade 1 by Miranda Goshawk    
A History of Magic by Bathilda Bagshot    
Magical Theory by Adalbert Waffling    
A Beginner's Guide to Transfiguration by Emeric Switch    
One Thousand Magical Herbs and Fungi by Phyllida Spore    
Magical Drafts and Potions by Arsenius Jigger    
Fantastic Beasts and Where to Find Them by Newt Scamander    
The Dark Forces: A Guide to Self-Protection by Quentin Trimble  
These books line up with his subjects during his first year. Only astronomy is left behind. The questionable books are standard book of spells and fantastic beasts. The former is the only book that the students have to buy every year and is probably a generally used book. But fantastic beasts is kind of odd.    
No one in the books ever reads from the book and its existence is only touched on in the book list and briefly mentioned in book 5 and 7. The first use that comes to mind for it is care for magical beasts class but that is class starting at this grade and not all students even take it. I have two theories on why this book is on the list:     
    
1. The students are thrown into a new world and it is an educational guide to the magical world. Especially muggle borns are vulnerable to a random doxie or gnome etc. if they never heard of this. The problem I have with this explanation is that there are some books that should have definitely be on the list if that was the intend. The history of hogwarts would have been a great addition to that list as Hermione demonstrates in every book.    
2. JKR wanted to make beasts class happen in year one but scrapped it. Some classes really fall short in the story. We never learn why they have astronomy and what that has to do with magic. I can imagine she thought of potential classes and forgot to delete the book from the list before publishing. This would also explain why astronomy is the only class that lacks a book. She simply glossed over the book list after making changes to the classes.    
What do you think? Is there a perfect explanation to my question? Did I gloss over a post that already answered this question?"

The sixth book reads like a true crime novel set in a fictional world. Voldemort displays his psychopathic nature from his childhood. 

He likes to collect trophies that remind him of his misfits (foreshadowing horcruxes as reminder of his crimes). He's megalomaniac and treats his criminal life like it's a career he can be proud of. Young Voldemort is also charming and uses his charisma to approach his victims like Hepzibah Smith.

It probably brings up a lot of emotions and trauma he has repressed.

 I think them laughing further sets him off as they think he is being too modest but I think Harry then feels they are not taking him seriously and it is interesting that Hermione actually saying Voldemort’s name is what actually calms him down and he can see how serious she is.

Snape from the start seems to dislike him for reasons Harry doesn’t know why and out of Harry’s control. This sets the tone for their relationship and Harry returns this dislike and associates Snape as someone who is out to get him. 

Over the years many more things happen that contribute to this feud and Harry can be unreasonable about Snape but I think ultimately he is so much younger and so it hard to expect him to be the more mature one and rise above it. His defensiveness is pretty understandable and I think scenes like Snape’s reaction in GOF to Harry saying Crouch is here and needs to talk to Dumbledore sort of reinforces in Harry’s mind the idea that Snape is someone he can’t trust. He is wrong and this is a flaw of his in being too black and white in his thinking about Snape and I think once he has all the information he realises this on the end and can recognise everything Snape went through and sacrificed. I like Snape as a character and understand that Harry was very triggering for him as a reminder of James and also a reminder of losing Lily and all that guilt. He is very interesting and compelling as a character but I think Harry’s dislike and distrust of Snape is mainly of Snape’s own doing and while Harry certainly made mistakes and didn’t help, I don’t agree with fans who pin it all on Harry."

2. Why go to the effort of writing in Tonks as an animorphmagi (sp?) and not really using the gift for something more important than pulling faces (or perhaps I’ve forgotten a part of her story?) 3. Why doesn’t Draco take the invisibility cloak from Potter after smashing his nose on the train? It could’ve really helped him in the task he is supposed to do… 
Bonus q: It says that Voldy doesn’t think anyone else knows about the room of requirement where things are hidden yet surly he heard all the details of his DE’s getting into the castle that way…?"

668,1688160759.0,HarryPotterBooks,"A small but significant detail in GOF - Everytime polyjuice potion is mentioned, Mad Eye Moody is mentioned or is around. The night Harry loses the map, Moody is around after Harry sees Barty Crouch on it. Snape mentions ingredients for the potion, and mentions Moody's name in the conversation. Throughout the entire book, Moody is consistently brought up around Polyjuice potion, which on close reading becomes very clear. Moody is also around every time Mr Crouch is mentioned or makes an appearance after the real moody is abducted. Rowling was clearly laying some subtle clues throughout the story that Moody might not be who or what he appears. He also fixates on Neville in the first lesson, and you later learn he was implicated in torturing Neville's parents."

670,1688149630.0,HarryPotterBooks,"Harry worry that Sirius is going to leave the house- how much do you think that the things Hermione and Molly say about Sirius influence that fear - Hermione is one of his his best friends and yes Harry doesn’t agree with everything she says but he does listen to her and values her perspective. She tells Harry not to worry about Sirius but she talks about how unhappy and lonely Sirius is stuck in that house and how that could potentially make him reckless. 

Harry can also relate to that and he could see himself acting in a similar way so then he worries about Sirius doing the same. Molly also talks about Sirius needing to be careful and Harry hears some of their more heated exchanges and he can see himself and empathise with Sirius’s misery and trauma as well as wanting to be in the centre of the action  so this makes Harry worry about how Snape calling Sirius a coward will affect him. The interesting thing is Sirius doesn’t actually leave the house for good until Harry himself goes to the Department of Mysteries believing Sirius to be in danger  and that makes everything so much more tragic."

674,1688121160.0,HarryPotterBooks,"Barty Crouch jr - Just some thoughts I've been having about the goblet of fire. I was thinking it feels a bit unbelievable to have Barty Crouch in polyjuice for an entire year. We know it takes a month to brew and it's complex to make (albeit Crouch is skilled at potions). He then had to act exactly like the real Moody without raising any suspicion. All while manipulating the events of the book and teaching classes.

I wondered if anyone thought it would be more realistic if he had hid out in the castle all year and manipulated the events where he could. Potentially using the potion to become Moody at key points in the year. As the reader we could see everyone wonder why Moody was acting off that particular day but then just attribute it to his general ""madness"". Crouch could possibly get the better of Moody, become him, act out the necessary deeds then erase the real Moody's memory. I think this would be a more fitting trait for a death eater as it involves physically overpowering someone and being devious at the same time.

Additionally, we would've had a chance to know the real Moody for a year without it all being snatched by the realisation that it was a disguise.

Bonus points for Harry spotting Crouch on the map in various locations as he hides out (maybe Timmy riddle told him how to get into the chamber of secrets to hide out).

I feel upon rereads as well, it would become painfully obvious to the reader when Moody was himself and when it was the imposter.

Most of the things that happen in the Books and not in movies have been a pleasant surprise, because I liked the movies but just gave it a try to the 3 first books, i know... Tip of the iceberg talk for now

The things I liked was that sirus/remus story was more developed, that the house was used by Remus, that the 4 gave him company, when transormed, the reason of the nicknames.

Curiously I've found Ron way better than M-Ron (Movie Ron) it feels sometimes that M-Ron is like Book Neville + Protagonism lol.

I went a bit sad not knowing until now how lots of characters talk way more, participation of Percy, Parvati, Wood (specially Wood), the Weasley twins, even Crookshanks! etc.etc. All those side-background characters that even if they say little they give a bit of ""yeah we exist"" . Also quidditch... Would've loved some more quidditch time tbh.

682,1688090066.0,HarryPotterBooks,"It really is lucky that Harry met Ron on the train. He 100% would have turned into a serial killer otherwise. - I know it’s something of a meme that I post random Dark Lord Harry dialogue, but let’s get serious for a minute. 

Do the math here. Harry has just about every reason to be Voldemort 2.0

- grew up in an abusive household

- Dumbledore knew and sanctioned this, and actively covered it up

- literally every muggle he knows is an absolute bastard

- Dumbledore arranged all of this so that Harry can die at a convenient time and destroy the great evil that Dumbledore himself spent years ignoring

- he’s been filthy rich this whole time, but thanks to Dumbledore, had to grow up malnourished and abused. Which, I might add, continued even after he started attending school. 

Fortunately for the entire world, he sat with Ron. It very easily could have gone differently. 

If he’d sat alone, I give it two summer breaks before he murders Dudley. 

If he sat with Draco Malfoy, he literally becomes the new Dark Lord. Defeating Voldemort as a baby is a mystery. 

Wait until Draco tells his father about the Sorcerer’s Stone incident. 

“Father, I have news! The Dark Lord is still alive!”

“He was possessing our DADA professor. And he tried to finish the job on Potter. It was looking grim there for a minute. The Dark Lord ordered his thrall to kill him. And then, I cannot stress this enough, father. Bear with me on this. Potter proceeded to melt Quirrel’s face with wandless magic.”

683,1688088078.0,HarryPotterBooks,Anybody ever wonder how Lily and Petunia got orphaned? - When it comes to Harry having dead grandparents since birth has only slightly been explained. According  to Rowling James was a surprise late in life pregnancy to the middle age childless Potter’s thus grew up rather spoiled rotten causing his arrogant jock persona. later Mr and Mrs Potter passed away of natural causes (despite it being established that wizards have a supernatural life expectancy but who am I to nitpick) tho with the Evans there has never been any reason given why there dead. My theory is that the Evans parents where killed in a car crash when the sisters where teenagers and that they lived with there grandparents until they where adults this would give reason as to how the animosity between Lily and Petunia worsened as Petunia would have went on always resenting them for having felt that Lily was the favourite and never getting closer. (And she would just be using the same cause of death for her parents when she fibbed about James and Lily’s murder making it rather more layered in context) makes you wonder if Petunia even bothered going to her parents funeral as she clearly disowned them ever since (according to Harry the Dursley house doesn’t have any photos of the Evans) just goes to show how much she loathed being a part of that family.

I dont know if it counts as Irony and I dont think I understand Voldemorts ambitions other than power. But could his mother have inadvertently caused her own son’s rise and fall? 

Obviously he made his own choices and went down his own path, but early childhood is important in the ethics and morals department. And having an effed experience as a kid can really screw things down the road.

It is the world of my dreams in my childhood, but I am pleased to say that muggles have since caught up. 

Video chat has become widespread and common. So many meetings are conducted like so I daresay most of us are sick of them. But that only puts us in par with the wizarding community. What will make wizards want to have wi-fi and really live in muggle communities is the internet and social media. Just by inputting a word, you can find all manner of information on it. Recipes, reviews, how tos, the works. 

With social media, you can see all kinds of opinions people have on anything in this world and put your own voice in too. You can make friends with people far across the world as long as you speak the same language. Unthinkable even for wizards. I daresay Harry Potter had no idea the computer Dudley broke would be used for so much more than games in only a decade to come, nor that everyone would have computers called smartphones in their pockets. 

The second thing that muggles have accomplished is also related to the internet, but also transportation. It is called internet shopping. With a press of a finger, I can get items only available in far away places delivered to me. Hell, if I am lazy, I can get anything delivered to me. Breakfast? Lunch? Dinner? A pencil? Wizards still have to go to the shops if they want anything

Muggles still cannot point a stick at others and murder them at once, but who wants to? In terms of convenience, we certainly have it much better. And this shift happened only in a few years."
705,1687904414.0,HarryPotterBooks,"In Harry Potter Book 1, was there a funeral for Lily and James? - "
706,1687887781.0,HarryPotterBooks,"Calling Harry Dumb is a Mischaracterization - I’ve read a few posts of people calling Harry dumb, and even Crouch - who was smart in his own right - calling him dumb in the books.

Now in a way, they make good points. For one thing, in the Goblet of Fire, Crouch really set it up well so that Harry’d have an easy time. He gave Hagrid the idea to show Harry the dragons. When he checked if Harry figured out a way past it and realized he had no clue, he gave him the biggest nudge he could while still remaining unsuspicious.  He gave Neville the exact book Harry would’ve needed, believing Harry would have asked everyone for help. He even went out of his way to knock nearly every challenge - even Crumb - out of the way to make sure he’d reach the end.

And what happened? Harry gives his biggest chance to take out a competitor by telling Cedric about the Dragons. He required a giant nudge to come up with the fact that what he’s literally the best at is something that trivializes the task - albeit, only being possible because he’s an amazing flyer and a great tactician. He never even thinks to ask for help in the second task because he feels ashamed and needed yet another manipulation of someone to get him Deus Ex Machina’d out of trouble. And even then he only makes it through by the skin of his teeth because he makes the dumbest decision without considering the fact that Dumbledore wouldn’t let anyone die. Then in the maze, despite nearly every challenge being ripped away from his path, he literally forces his way off the path to find trouble.

All of these are great examples to support their assertion. However, the reasoning is more nuanced, and we’re literally told why he reacts to things the way he does at the beginning. Gryffindor’s value courage, bravery, nerve, and chivalry. Basically boiled down: honorable. 

The choices he naturally makes are not done out of “what is the most logical”, but “what is the most right”. He shows this when he’s in situations where he can’t make simple decisions that protect his life. When the person he is continuously told ruthlessly manipulated his parents and was now right in front of him, he literally could not make the decision to just end his life. What he faced was an moral quandary which he instinctually felt carried weight. When He told Cedric about the dragons, there wasn’t a plan. He was even caught off guard when Cedric treated him like he had to have an ulterior motive because he literally didn’t consider it, then giving him a half-baked explanation “It’s only fair, right?” It wasn’t about Cedric himself or winning. In his head, it was just the right thing to do. Then when Moody tried to clue him in on the strategy for the task, it isn’t his lack of out-of-the-box thinking that kept the strategy from him, it was the idea that, to him, a competition is fought on even footing, with what’s on hand. He didn’t even consider the fact that outside things can come in because his brain cordons those ideas off as underhanded before they even come to the forefront of his mind. When faced with the idea of cheating in the tournament, it’s outlandish until he feels that someone that he genuinely cares about is in danger. Then at the end of the second task, the mere thought that someone might actually die for a competition causes him to go directly against the goal, saving everyone and nearly attacking the mermen for trying to stop him. When he thought someone was in actual danger in the maze, he instantly bolts towards them because he believes the right thing to do is to help.

Basically, no decision he’s forced to make even engages with his intellectual side. He’s predisposed to treat situations as moral quandaries, even if he acts like a brat. That why he’s the best Gryffindor. When faced with the prospect of possibly having to be a Slytherin, he’s not afraid because Draco might be his roommate. He’s scared because the idea of being destined to be someone doing evil goes against his entire being. He’s as afraid of it as a phobia, as in he knows the fear is irrational, but he can’t place why it’s their. It’s like being a puzzle piece and someone trying to shove you in the wrong spot.

It’s also why I believe Dumbledore had realized he was wrong about him in the end. Harry will always go with what is right. If he was supplied with the information about everything beforehand, Dumbledore realized Harry would have been even better prepared than he was, because at his core, fear, fame, and the desire for power doesn’t control him. But he naturally understands the fundamentals of why he needs them, allowing him to use them as tools to protect the people he loves and fight for what’s really right, not just what someone tells him is."

708,1687869404.0,HarryPotterBooks,"Wizard elementary school? - Where do young witches and wizards learn the basic stuff - reading, writing, calculus (EDIT: sorry, mistranslation from my language. I mean arithmetics), maybe a foreign language, etc? We know there's none of that at Hogwarts, and anyway, they can't wait until they're 11 to learn that stuff. 

I don't think it's hinted at anywhere in the books, but what do we think about this? Do they go to Muggle school? Is it homeschooling only? Or is there a Wizarding elementary school? 

Here's why I think there is such a school. 

**Muggle school** doesn't sound like a great ideal: of course, Muggle-borns (and Harry, having been raised by a Muggle family ever) go to Muggle school until they're 11. But I don't think *every* young witch and wizard can. We know that they have trouble keeping their magic under control when scared/angry/happy. A few of them, sure. But for *all* young wizards to go to Muggle school? That sounds like a load of breaches of the Statute of Secrecy, every year. Ain't enough Obliviators for that! 


**Homeschooling** might work in the Weasley case, or in any family when one of the parents is a stay-at-home mom/dad or works from home. However, that's not every family. So the possibility might exist,  but it's not the majority. 


So I think there are **Wizarding Elementary Schools**. Children go there since the age of 4 or 5 and learn all the basic stuff, probably not exactly like Muggles do (you'd probably learn to read with the Tales of Beedle the Bard), but close. When they turn 11, they go to Hogwarts where it gets way more interesting. 

So, what do you think? Are there other possibilities?"

You’d think pretty much everyone who graduated would have the ability to do it if it was drilled so hard during school. I suppose not everyone has to pass their classes to graduate, just if they’d want a better career. 

I cant remember when they said it but I could’ve sworn that its mentioned at least once. But maybe I’m just misremembering because the more I think about it we see characters a lot of nonverbal magic before the kids start studying it.

1) What determines the strength of a wizard. Why are Voldemort and Dumbledore considered so great? Age? Knowledge?

712,1687824158.0,HarryPotterBooks,"I read the first 4 books when i was 11 years old and 23 years later i read the rest. I am both amazed, sad and… hopeful. - I had an itch to read fantasy books again (after some GRRM, Steven Erickson’s Malazan and starting Mistborn) and i decided to finish what i started when i was a kid.

My god. I felt both old, and very weird. But when i dove into book 5 it was like seeing an old friend. Like running at the schoolyard again. I grew up with HP and i have very strong memories, like being scared so much with the dementors that i couldn’t sleep for days. Last month I picked up my old copies of the first 4 books from my old home and checked the publish date. I realised here i am, 23 years later continuing the story, even though i know where it goes having seen the movies.

I know HP isn’t the pinnacle of writing in the scholarly circles, but i can’t help but see part of myself into Harry. No i haven’t had any deep connection with death like Harry, nor i experienced bad foster parents or anything like that. I grew up in a normal happy family in a town in europe and there is something in me that identifies so much with Harry’s story. I think it is this longing that i have to do something good for the world, something meaningful to change it for the better.

And it makes me sad that today’s world, a world riddled with wars, hate and ignorance, i failed to do it. 

Maybe this sounds stupid, maybe it is the brainwash that we get when we are growing up that we can improve the world, that we are the chosen ones in our story. But growing up we realise that we cannot do it, maybe not at least in one fell swoop. We can’t yell “expelliarmus” and vanquish the daily struggles of anyone. 

Reading the conversation between Harry and Voldemort right before the final duel, Harry explaining to him why he will win, being so confident, after spending a lifetime of living in uncertainty, fear, ignorance, and every human emotion, reminds me of why i, we, should strive to be better. To reach the final battle ready.

Having the faith that when that moment comes, we will be ready, brave and confident that we will do the right thing, regardless if this battle is a specific crucial moment in our lives that we need to make the right choice, or a time when we look back and say yes, i did my best, i am happy with myself.

The important thing, is to not give up,no matter how dark or late you think it is.

Have a nice day!"

721,1687691317.0,HarryPotterBooks,"Triwizard Tournament Theory - Hey so I've been thinking about a detail in TGOF and I've never seen anything online about it. So I don't know if it's just a coincidence but the three challenges of the Triwizard tournament (of 1994 at least) seems to be related to the Deathly Hallows, at least in what they symbolize. First the best way to win the Dragon challenge is to be as stealthy as possible, because there's no way an apprentice wizard can beat a dragon in a fight, also avoiding the dragon is kind of similar to avoiding Death, which is the main purpose of the Invisibility cloak. The goal of the second challenge is litteraly to save a loved one from death which is almost the same as the legend of the Resurrection stone.   
Finally in the third challenge, the Maze, the goal is of course to beat the maze, but mostly to beat everything on your path including monsters and other wizards, the elder wand being the best way to win this. (Actually the elder wand would be useful in any of the challenges but I think it would be the best in this particular challenge)  
Of course this theory is very flawed, and I don't really know what to do with it, but I needed to share it since I've been thinking about it for a long time. "

I got so curious to know what happened next that I just felt that I had to read it instead of going through the first book just to read what I wanted afterwards.

However, I am aware of the downsides of doing this, especially how JK Rowling always mentions on the books things that happened in its predecessor. So far, there has been a few cases that I didn't know what it was until it is mentioned that it happened in Harry's first year. On the other hand, I haven't missed so much, thus I don't have difficulty when it comes to understand the other books.

762,1687164417.0,HarryPotterBooks,"How did Voldemort think he was the only person to find the RoR? - From DH after Harry realises the Diadem is hidden in the Room of Requirement;

“He knew, at last, where the Horcrux sat waiting for him … Tom Riddle, who confided in no one and operated alone, might have been arrogant enough to assume that he, and only he, had penetrated the deepest mysteries of Hogwarts Castle.” 

When Voldemort hid the Diadem, did he think he was the only student to have ever found the room? 

The diadem is hidden alongside thousands of other hidden items. 

Voldemort was surely not the first person to use the room to hide something. So if the Room opened to him and showed the thousands of other items surely he’d realise not he alone knew about the room which weakened the Diadem’s protection.

My initial thought was that when Voldemort asked the Room to provide a hiding place it presented an empty room and then “stored” the diadem alongside thousands of other items.

Each character she creates feels unique and relatable. You can understand their perspectives on the world, and how they differ from each other, even if you don’t agree with them.  
  
I think one of the things that makes a great character is when you can predict what they would probably do in particular situations.  
  
For example - how to deal with Buckbeak after he attacked Malfoy. I have a good idea in my head about how Arthur, Molly, Ludo Bagman, Slughorn and Lockhart might all respond to that situation and each response is slightly different. This tells me these characters have been very well realised by the author.  
  
I think of other stories by other writers and can think of examples where the characters feel samey and bland. They all talk and behave in roughly similar ways. I love the JKR was able to create such a rich world of characters."

This implies the Prewett’s also had a family fortune as a Black heiress was obviously not going to marry into a family without a net worth (unless they were risking getting disowned) from what little we know about Molly’s family is that the Prewett’s are a line of celebrated Auror’s like her brothers the twins Fabian and Gideon tho considering her great aunt Muriel is a racist grandma stereo-type it’s likely liberal thinking is a new thing.
776,1687039919.0,HarryPotterBooks,"Snape produced a doe Patronus then said ""always"" - I don't understand this part of the book. Would you please help me understand the conversation between Dumbledore and Snape?

So Dumbledore asked Snape beforehand, ""Have you grown to care for the boy?""
Snape didn't answer but produced a Patronus. Dumbledore realised that it was a doe and *shed tears* before asking him ""After all this time?"". ""Always"" answered Snape.

So Snape's answer to the question is ""yes"" by showing Dumbledore his Patronus? And Dumbledore understood immediately. But how? What part or Snape's Patronus being a doe revealed his affection toward Harry? Doesn't it only prove that he loves Lily? But Dumbledore already knew that from the very beginning. So what made Dumbledore *tearful*? What is the connection between his Patronus and Harry?

I know Snape sent the Patronus to lead Harry to the sword of Gryffindor. I read the books and watched the movies. But in the movie they revealed this right after that conversation. But we know from the books that they are two separate occasions. Because the night Harry saw the doe Patronus was long after Dumbledore's death. 

In light of reddit blackouts and r/harrypotter is still private till this day, I've been looking for answers somewhere else. I found some answers in Quora that are several years old and a lot of people seemed to think that Snape producing a doe patronus is him basically saying ""I only did it for Lily"". But again Dumbledore knew from the beginning that Snape only switched side because Lily died because of him and he wanted redemption.

So again? Why was he tearful?"

779,1687033980.0,HarryPotterBooks,"Hogwarts Castle plans, models and maps - What do you think of exisiting models of Hogwarts Castle based on books only?  
  
I know about Harper Robinson sketches, I have read analysis from White Hound of Madasafish. But still I was not satisfied. So idea came to my mind to model this castle again, by myself, to be as close to the canon descriptions as possible.  
  
Floor plans, maps and models were inspired by novels, so I wanted the castle to be one solid building with 7 floors, 1 courtyard and 0 bridges. Media universe (movies and games) has different approach (castle divided into two parts, no one cares about floors, many courtyards and bridges) which I like also, but it contradicts to canon, so in my opininion it is setting a different universe. Also grounds were never presented like in the books. My proposition is the castle to have four wings like cardinal directions, especially that East wing was mentioned.  
  
I wanted to locate every mentioned important location and put it on map. For the purposes of this project, I followed the principle that each room is always in the same place (sorry Rowena Ravenclaw). We have some contradictions in novels that I try to explain and choose perfect location.

780,1687028047.0,HarryPotterBooks,"Plot hole in Lily’s sacrifice - So Harry was protected by Lily’s love, her attempt to shield him from the Dark Lord, giving her life for him.

Yet in TDH, Harry sees Voldemort striding along, knocking on Gregorovich’s old door, where a smiling woman opened it, with her kids behind her. Voldemort asks where Gregorovich is, she replies he’s not here anymore, he moved. Then Harry awakes as she casts her arms out wide to try and shield her children from Voldemort. He says “I’ve just watched Voldemort kill a woman, and he’s likely killed her children by now too”.

Didn’t that woman just make the same sacrifice as Lily did? Shouldn’t her sacrifice for her kids have created the same protective charm for her kids as Lily did, therefore essentially creating more Harry Potters?

And to top that off, James stood, unarmed against Voldemort telling Lily to take Harry and run. He basically stood facing down the barrel of certain death, hoping his brief death would permit his wife and child a chance to escape. Why weren’t Lily and Harry protected from that?

And to top THAT off, wouldn’t this be a known danger of anyone going to kill a family? Surely Lily wasn’t the first person to give their life in a direct attempt to save a loved one. 

Wouldn’t this be like, evil guy 101: when killing a family, if one sacrifices themselves for a loved one, DO NOT use a curse on the protected one, use a pillow to smother them, because if a pillow backfires, you’ll probably be alright.

781,1687014060.0,HarryPotterBooks,"Which twists and reveals surprised you the most and which did you predict? Also, did you incorrectly predict anything? - Correct predictions:

\-Dumbledore dies. I just assumed that to raise the stakes, Harry's most powerful protector and the only person Voldemort ever feared would have to take a fall. I think this is quite a frequent narrative device.

\-Harry would have to die/was a Horcrux. *Guess there was still a lot of unpredictable nuance around this idea, though.*

\-Harry's vision of Sirius being tortured was fabricated by Voldemort to coax him into danger.

\-Snape being good the whole time. This was brilliantly done and I absolutely love Snape's arc, but, because of the previous 6 books I was expecting twists.. and this one was relatively low-hanging fruit.  


Biggest surprises:

\-The series of reveals at the end of Prisoner of Azkaban absolutely blew my mind (the animagi, Sirius being good, Peter Pettigrew being Scabbers (whom we've known for 3 books!), Lupin being a werewolf, Time travel, Harry's patronus etc.) and I don't think Ive ever had a similar 'Holy Fuck' moment from fiction (perhaps embarassingyl lol). I defy anyone who claims they predicted the animagi/Sirius/Peter reveals.

\-In GOF - primed after the aforementioned twists in POA - I was literally anticipating the villain at Hogwarts to be the person I *least* expected.... And Moody was still the *only person* I 100% ruled out. His history, his personality, friendship with Dumbledore and the way he looked after and helped Harry etc. It was brilliantly constructed.  


Incorrect predictions:

\-I thought there was going to be something made of Neville being born in July and it was he who was, in fact, the true chosen one. Im glad that didn't happen, though. Would have been a step too far.  Also, the fact that it *could have been...* had Voldemort gone to Neville's house rather than Harry's - still makes it very interesting and poignant.

Lily and James had a cat, obviously a magical cat, smarter then your average feline, listens and picks up information. Has met their friends. Voldemort shows up, kills them, cat escapes. Gets picked up and brought to the magical Menagerie. Crookshanks acts awful so it doesn’t get adopted for so long because it’s hoping to see Harry. Finally they walk in, but when seeing Harry, he also sees Peter. Crookshanks has SEEN Peter pettigrew before, but also has heard that he’s supposed to be dead, so knows something’s messed up, tries to kill Peter. 

They get to school, he still is trying to get Peter. Then meets Sirius. Knows Sirius from before as well, but has heard the rumors, so as Sirius says “takes time to trust him”. Then once Crookshanks realizes Sirius was innocent all along, he works with Sirius to recapture Peter. Again, Crookshanks listens. Knows Neville wrote down the passwords, steals them for Sirius. When Peter fakes his death again, Crookshanks tells Sirius, and knows it’s faked because again, Crookshanks listens and KNEW Peter had done it before. He knew what to look for and what to be suspicious of because he had been through all this before, as lily and James’s pet.

However, book James and Lily were only 21 when they died. People don't really change as Sirius claims James did, I'm thinking Sirius was just reminiscing about James and Lily with fondness and ignored the part that James was still an arrogant douche when he died, and I suspect Lily being the sweetheart she seems to be from the books would've eventually realised James hadn't changed and eventually left him.

“-You don’t think they’re watching the house?”

“Watching-spying-might be following us,” muttered Uncle Vernon wildly…”

It got me thinking about how the mystery and fun of these beginning chapters could’ve been amplified if the first chapter was moved to be right after Letters From No One (chapter 3).

I feel like keeping the “mystery” of Harry having magic/coming from a magical world behind a curtain for these first few chapters would’ve been a fun way to start the book. The boa constrictor and letter scenes would also seem more bizarre and unanswered.

Then, right as Hagrid breaks down the door at the end of chapter 3, we flashback to that night ten years ago (maybe even recalled by Hagrid himself)

Of course the “mystery” of Harry being a wizard isn’t exactly a big surprise, and having events being too out of order might confuse younger readers, but I think it’s an interesting idea.

This seems to be taken as read that either Harry Potter or Voldemort must kill the other. And this is true in the first part but what has always bugged me is that they are both alive quite happily at the same time. However, it actually goes much deeper than that: 'Neither can LIVE while the other SURVIVES'; it means neither can get on with their lives, can fulfill their dreams or their desires, until the other one no longer survives. And this is well borne out in the books; for the first 11 years both Voldemort and Harry are in their own version of wilderness, one having been 'ripped from his body' and as near to death as possible, the other living a half life in servitude to his Aunt and Uncle. Then they both come into power and their whole existences are saturated with the other, both their lives taken up with trying to out-manoeuvre the other until it all finally comes to an end when Harry finishes off Voldemort at the end of Deathly Hallows. After which, Harry can finally get on with his life! He marries Ginny, has a family, becomes an auror etc. All because now that Voldemort no longer SURVIVES, Harry can now LIVE. Had it been the other way round and Harry been killed conclusively by Voldemort, then he would have been able to LIVE and fulfill his lust for power and immortality. Lucky escape!"
792,1686417508.0,HarryPotterBooks,"What does this part of Harry’s vision mean? - So I’m re-reading DH and in the chapter “Bathilda’s Secret”, Harry has a vision with a flashback to the day Voldemort murdered his parents, which merges with the present day's Voldemort entering Bathilda’s house. Now, between the two there is a line that confuses me:

""\[...\] *“Avada Kedavra!”*  
*And then he broke; He was nothing, nothing but pain and terror, and he must hide himself, not here in the rubble of the ruined house, where the child was trapped and screaming, but far away... far away...*  
“No,” he moaned.  
*The snake rustled on the filthy, cluttered floor,* ***and he had killed the boy, and yet he was the boy*** *...*  
“No...”  
*And now he stood at the broken window of Bathilda’s house, immersed in memories of his greatest loss, and at his feet the great snake slithered over broken china and glass... He looked down and saw something...something incredible*... \[...\]""

What does Voldemort mean when he thinks that he “had killed the boy, and yet he was the boy”? Because I’m assuming that “he had killed the boy"" might refer to him not yet connecting the dots that the Killing Curse failed (though still weird, since he does note that the child is still screaming), but the “yet he was the boy"" part? Is this a reference to the Horcrux in Harry? Or were the visions mutual to some extent, meaning that Voldemort had dipped briefly into Harry’s mind too? Or was it some deeper flashback to his orphanage days? 

Also, just to make sure, “The snake rustled on the filthy, cluttered floor” must refer already to Nagini in Bathilda's hut, right? It’s placed in such a weird place in the vision that I can’t decide, but otherwise it’d mean that Nagini had been at Godric’s Hollow, and that makes no sense. "

I know, I know... ghosts are ""stuck"" -- they can't learn new things or develop (paraphrased from the Pottermore article) -- but that can't actually be entirely true. Nick knows Harry. He recognizes him, even after Harry has been absent from the castle for nearly a year. 

I like to think that Harry finally supplied her with the simple friendship she had been looking for, without conditions or further expectations, throughout her life. Her mother wanted certain things from her; the Baron wanted other things. But Harry needed her help, she trusted him (a gamble on her part), and I like to think that the paid off that trust by developing a relationship with her.

This one i could understand being explained by the board of governors or parents like Lucius Malfoy refusing to ever allow it, but it would make sense especially for Dumbledore to force it. Maybe you'd change some bigoted wizards minds by letting them see that muggle technology or inventions can improve their lives. Maybe Draco Malfoy would actually enjoy using a phone to call Crabbe instead of kneeling into a fireplace.

As the title says i am wondering if Invisibility cloaks were not only a thing but a seemingly plentiful thing before the Deathly hallows made Harrys an ancient and impossible thing to acquire more then once. My evidence is as follows

In book 1 Ron says that “Invisibility cloaks are super rare” or something along the lines indicating that invisibility cloaks do exist in a substantial number to be a known artifact. 

In Book 4th Barty crouch Jr reveals his father hid him under an invisibility cloak for a long time. 

Finally in Book 5 its said that Mundugus Fletcher cane out from a “Silvery bundle Harry recognized as an Invisibility cloak” 

Now of course in the Deathly Hallows Lunas father says that the cloak Death gave Harrys ancestor was a TRUE invisibility cloak from deaths own robe not anything less effective like one Woven from Unicorn hair which is convincing but loses effectiveness after time."

However, Ron saw himself as the head boy, quidditch captain and champion, house champion, and overall the greatest of the Weasley siblings. Harry saw himself surrounded by his family. 

Ron does become a prefect, and if he went for his last year he could very well have been the head boy. He helped his house win the house cup and his quidditch team win the quidditch cup. He was most importantly part of the golden trio. He definitely has a case as the most important Weasley sibling, and definitely distinguished himself from his brothers.

Harry never gets his family back, but he does get to be with them during his battle at the end of GOF and on his way to through the forbidden forest in DH. Throughout the story he gets pictures and belongings of his family and learns much about them. 

One could say that the mirror showed him with a loving family, and he definitely gains a loving family throughout the books. The Weasley, Hermione, Sirius, Lupin, Hagrid, and so on.

So overall, in these two cases you can argue that the mirror did show them their futures.

Edit: this is also, in my opinion, one of the most wholesome chapters of the of the whole series. Just the realization that Harry has in seeing his parents for the first time, his desire to keep returning, and this is Dumbledore’s and Harry’s first real interaction."
807,1685989713.0,HarryPotterBooks,"This Subreddit will be shutting down temporarily between June 12th - 14th (in solidarity with hundreds of other subreddits) to protest Reddit’s new API changes. - Hello everyone. The moderation team of /r/HarryPotterBooks wants to share some serious concerns we have about recent changes to Reddit.

A recent Reddit policy change threatens to *kill* many beloved third-party mobile apps, making a great many quality-of-life features not seen in the official mobile app **permanently inaccessible** to users.

On May 31st, 2023, Reddit announced they were raising the price to make calls to their API from being free to a level that will kill every third party app on Reddit, from [Apollo](https://www.reddit.com/r/apolloapp/comments/13ws4w3/had_a_call_with_reddit_to_discuss_pricing_bad/) to [Reddit is Fun](https://www.reddit.com/r/redditisfun/comments/13wxepd/rif_dev_here_reddits_api_changes_will_likely_kill/?utm_source=reddit&utm_medium=usertext&utm_name=ModCoord&utm_content=t3_13ze03s) to [Narwhal](https://www.reddit.com/r/getnarwhal/comments/13wv038/reddit_have_quoted_the_apollo_devs_a_ridiculous/jmdqtyt/) to [BaconReader](https://www.reddit.com/r/baconreader/comments/13wveb2/reddit_api_changes_and_baconreader/?utm_source=reddit&utm_medium=usertext&utm_name=ModCoord&utm_content=t3_13ze03s).

Even if you're not a mobile user and don't use *any* of those apps, this is a step toward killing other ways of customizing Reddit, such as [Reddit Enhancement Suite](https://www.reddit.com/r/Enhancement/) or the use of the old.reddit.com desktop interface (which is beloved by our modteam, and our *preferred* way for you to view this subreddit on desktop, by the way).

This isn't only a problem for users: many subreddit moderators *depend* on tools only available outside the official app to keep their communities on-topic and spam-free. It’d be wonderful if Reddit’s official apps supported these tools, but they do not, and are years behind what third party apps can do.

On top of everything else, for the visually impaired, iOS is a disaster.

#What's the plan?

The moderation team of r/HarryPotterBooks is declaring its opposition [(along with hundreds of other subreddits)](https://old.reddit.com/r/ModCoord/comments/1401qw5/incomplete_and_growing_list_of_participating/) to this API pricing change, and will be shutting down the subreddit in solidarity for 48 hours on June 12th through the 14th (and may even shut down *indefinitely*) until the tools to provide effective moderation are available once more. This isn't something any of us do lightly: we do what we do because ***we love Reddit***, and we truly believe this change will make it impossible to keep doing what we love. This subreddit is honestly one of my pride and joys on Reddit.

**The two-day blackout isn't the goal**, and it isn't the end. Should things reach the 14th with no sign of Reddit choosing to fix what they've broken, we'll use the community and buzz we've built between then and now as tools to take **further action.**

808,1685864017.0,HarryPotterBooks,"The petty part of me comes out every time I get to the end of HBP—Harry kinda deserved to say “I told you so.” - After being mistrusted and doubted and gaslit throughout the whole book, Harry deserved to say “I told you so” because despite everything that happened, he was right about Draco Malfoy the entire time!

Especially because Hermione makes a point to say that she was right about Eileen Prince at least three times. 

Dumbledore’s death understandably overshadowed the revelation about Malfoy, but still. I always feel a little salty on his behalf. His instincts in this instance are spot on and after all the efforts people went through to dismiss him, I think a teensy little bit of validation is warranted."
809,1685845724.0,HarryPotterBooks,"I do not understand Book #7 at all - Hi everyone.

I must have read Book #7 a dozen times, but I still don't understand it.  I listed some of my questions below.  Hopefully, someone can explain.

* In Chapter #1, Voldemort says that he now knows that he must be the one to kill Harry.  When did Voldemort figure this out?  I know he never got to hear Trelawney's prophecy in Book #5.
* When did Dudley decide that Harry saved his life in Book #5?
* How do the Order of the Phoenix believe that Snape cannot get into Grimmauld Place?  After Dumbledore's death, the entire group became the Secret Keepers.  What prevents Snape from telling the Death Eaters where Grimmauld Place is?  In Chapter #6, it is said that Moody set up curses to keep Snape out and to bind his tongue if he tries to talk about the place.  Does that tongue binding curse prevent Snape from talking about Grimmauld Place anywhere or just when he is physically at the location?
* Why did Dumbledore leave Hermione the book?
* **What was the point of the Deathly Hallows?**  Did Dumbledore want the trio to obtain them so as to defeat Voldemort?  One theory I have is that Harry needed the Resurrection Stone to give himself up to Voldemort and the cloak to keep him invisible until the right moment.  However, if that is true, why does Dumbledore even leave Hermione the book?  Harry only needs two of the Deathly Hallows, according to this theory.  Another theory I have is that Dumbledore leaves Hermione the book because he thinks Voldemort was pursuing the Elder Wand.  Dumbledore wanted the trio to learn about the Deathly Hallows to prevent Voldemort from getting the Elder Wand.  However, in the last few chapters Dumbledore said he wanted Snape to end up with the Elder Wand.  I don't see how my second theory is true unless Dumbledore wrote his will after Malfoy became the Master of the wand at the end of Book #6.  Dumbledore saw that Snape did not end up with the Elder Wand and had to leave Hermione the book so the trio could prevent Voldemort from obtaining the wand.
* Why did the Elder Wand kill Voldemort?  Was it because Harry had become its Master?
* Why did Harry not feel pain when Voldemort used the Cruciatus curse on him in the Forbidden Forest?
* Why was it essential that Voldemort 'kill' Harry?  Dumbledore said that when explaining to Snape that Harry was the seventh horcrux.
* Did Malfoy recognize Harry at Malfoy's Manor?  Even if he couldn't tell that Harry was Harry, Ron and Hermione were perfectly identifiable.  Why did Malfoy seem so reluctant to identify them?
* What does Dumbledore mean when he says that he didn't want Harry to seize the Hallows at the wrong time?

Thanks everyone."
810,1685835388.0,HarryPotterBooks,"What motivated Regulus’ choices? - What do you make of Regulus’ betrayal and eventual death? Here’re some thoughts from u/mariananooo and me:

Why did Regulus try to stop Voldemort?

1. For ideological reasons. Regulus found out that the locket was a Horcrux, “wickedest of magical inventions” (HBP). He got a glimpse into Voldemort’s true nature, and was horrified by it. He probably also realized that the “great” lengths to which Voldemort went was for his own gain only. Voldemort didn’t have pure-blood supremacists’ interests at heart; he used them.
2. For sentiments. Kreacher later called Regulus ""defender of house-elves"" (DH). Ultimately, Regulus’ decision stemmed from his attachment to and concern for Kreacher. He was worried and disturbed by Kreacher's suffering, at which ""the Dark Lord only laughed"" (DH). This leads to our next topic.

Why did Regulus drink Voldemort’s cave potion?

1. To repent. Regulus couldn’t possibly put Kreacher through excruciating pain again. If he knew what Voldemort needed a house-elf for, he wouldn’t have volunteered Kreacher.
2. To die... Regulus gained a new understanding of the master-servant relationships that he and Kreacher each were in. Bound to a master who had no regard for anyone else’s life, Regulus could escape only through death.

This is not to say that Regulus wasn’t brave. He was. He did have a change of heart, and wanted to protect his family. u/mariananooo and I started this discussion, because we wondered if Voldemort underestimated not only house-elf magic, but also Regulus and Kreacher’s loyalty to each other. “…of love, loyalty, and innocence, Voldemort knows and understands nothing” (DH)."
811,1685686051.0,HarryPotterBooks,DAE think the series would be enhanced with a rotating 3rd person PoV style of narration (like GoT)? - Or is the story not complex enough to call for it?
812,1685675968.0,HarryPotterBooks,Does anybody wish that JKR wrote this series for an older audience similar to GOT? - Or is the children book just perfect? Let me know your thoughts either way. What changes do you see if it was written for an older audience?
813,1685675349.0,HarryPotterBooks,"Hermione and Ron - I just finished the e-books for the first time. Great experience! 

However, I just never fully believed the Ron and Hermione relationship. Ron is a great friend, extremely loyal, and I guess he’s involved in all these cool moments Harry produces. However, I don’t see the attraction. He clearly isn’t popular amongst the schoolgirls even to the very end. Some of things he suggests is so incredibly dumb, I imagine Hermione gets an “ick.” A lot of the times, Ron just seems like a character who got lucky that he sat next to Harry on the first day of school and he knows it. Therefor, he’ll follow him to the very end. The only thing I see is maybe Hermione has this desire to be accepted by a boy who would endlessly tease her as a kid. 

Whereas Hermione is at first a “know it all,” but has this huge transformation and grows to where her intellect is appreciated and is attractive in all settings even socially. She gives great advice to Ginny on her crush on Harry. She also becomes physically attractive as she gets older. I don’t think Ron had any transformation. 

It’s not a hot take but the Hermione and Draco relationship makes much more sense to me. The obvious problem with this relationship is that Draco hates mudbloods but we saw the same thing with Severus and Lilly. I think Draco and Hermoine fit because they’re the only two of their grade that can really challenge and push Harry to his extent.  Hermione also has an appreciation for complexity which I believe Draco is the most complex personality we see in the book. Ron might be the simplest. But maybe that’s the attraction. 

Let me know your thoughts! Wrote this on a whim so sorry for the poor writing."
814,1685649570.0,HarryPotterBooks,The way Harry’s relationship with Cho ended seems very realistic to me especially for teenagers- do you see their argument about Marietta as when their relationship completely ended - They are not happy and both have their own trauma and are dealing with a lot. They sort of just fall apart like Harry said. Their fight about Marietta seems to be their last conversation and ends badly and neither really talk to each other after that
815,1685649277.0,HarryPotterBooks,Do you think Harry’s able to empathise the most with Sirius regarding his misery at being shut up in Grimmauld place because of his own traumatic experiences at Privet Drive? - Don’t get me wrong there are many who are very sympathetic to him like Ron or Hermione and I am sure most feel bad for him but think this is the best way to ensure his safety ( I feel that would be Dumbledore’s perspective). Harry also doesn’t want to Sirius go out and agrees with that but he can relate to Sirius’s misery as he knows he would and feel and react the same way if he was stuck in Privet Drive as an adult a place he desperately wants to escape from. The summer was bad enough for him so I think he really gets Sirius
816,1685622668.0,HarryPotterBooks,"Precision in Grief and Rage - An exploration of how grief for Sirius informs Harry's characterisation in HBP. I wanted to talk about the shift in Harry's internal voice from Order of Phoenix to Half Blood Prince, and how his grief, guilt and immense self-loathing for his part in events around Sirius' death informs it. At the end of Order of Phoenix, Harry is a mess - of incoherent, unfocused grief, where he wishes he never wished more that he was anybody else:

""*Harry, suffering like this proves you are still a man! This pain is part of being human*— ”

""*I DON'T WANT  TO BE HUMAN!*” *Harry roared, and he seized one of the delicate silver instruments from the spindle-legged table beside him and flung it across the room*

The scene at Dumbledore's office is rife with how much he blames himself for his godfather's death. These feelings manifest in his behaviour in different ways:

1. **Refusing meals**

When we are first introduced to Harry in HBP, we are told he has shut himself away in his room, filled with ""chill emptiness"" he associated with Dementors. He has also been refusing meals. 

As far back as PS, the deprivation of food is associated with punishment in Harry's head - with Vernon punishing him with ""no meals"" as early as Chapter 2. Harry tends to not eat during times of intense stress (the lead up to First Task), or when he believes he is punishing himself. The time he believes he attacked Arthur as the snake, he hid himself in Buckbeak's room, refusing Mrs Weasley's call for food. He believed himself to be unworthy, and a contamination at the time - and only once he is assured by Ginny that he could not be possessed, he becomes hungry enough to grab a sandwich Mrs Weasley sent up to the room. 

Similarly, the moment Harry steps into the Burrow in HBP, he feels ""suddenly hungry"", associating the Weasley home as an infusion of life over the emptiness he felt. Essentially, the first two weeks back at Dursleys, Harry was punishing himself for Sirius' death. 

2. **Connecting with Tonks, Buckbeak**

Harry blames himself for Sirius' death so much that he avoids talking about him at all (he wolfs down his breakfast when Ron and Hermione bring him up) and suppresses his grief and rage surrounding the events of OOTP- unless he is sure that the person he is speaking to understands the weight of Sirius' loss. He brings up Sirius willingly only with Buckbeak (""missing him? But you're okay with Hagrid aren't you""), and Tonks (""I miss him too"") - two people he was sure are grieving Sirius the way he was (Hermione says Tonks was struggling with survivor's guilt early in the book, and that is the only time Harry speaks up, supposedly finding a connection with another person who blames themselves for Sirius' death: ""How does she work that one out?""). I mean he is wrong about what Tonks is truly upset about, but still. 

But it is telling that he seeks to connect with her -""I miss him too"" but he spends so much of the book externalising and avoiding his debilitating grief that he also cant stand to be around the new ""gloomy"" Tonks after some time. 

He also hopes Remus would write to him - an expectation of a connection from an adult that is quite big for Harry to admit to himself. Remus seems to sense this, and he offers an explanation even though he has never written to Harry before: ""I've been underground"". 

There is also a self-aware moment from Harry, whose hatred for Snape has intensified in the book: He admits to displacing some of his own self loathing and blame onto Snape as to make his own feelings about it easier (""Whatever Dumbledore had said ..(..) he clung to the notion because it felt good and also because he knew the one person who was not sorry Sirius Black was dead was walking beside him"")

3. **HBP textbook: A new father figure**

He gets attached to the Half Blood Prince textbook and gets excited at the possibility that it might belong to his father - even as he knows that his father is a pureblood. 

He defends the book to death until Sectumsempra - a book that becomes his guide and friend, a reflection of teenage Snape. The betrayal he feels with Sectumsempra is immense (""a beloved pet gone savage"")

Essentially, he makes an old textbook his new friend/ father figure - and him wanting the book to have belonged to James (or any of the Marauders) is one more proof of it. (""It's hard - to know he won't write to me again"" Harry admits to Dumbledore about Sirius' death).

4. **Going to adults with his theories/suspicions**

 In the previous book, Harry avoids going to adults at all unless he really had to or forced to. However, a result of events of OOTP, in HBP, Harry goes to every adult with all suspicions he has - and freely admits to his suspicions and what he does about this. This is a marked change in Harry - he tells Mr Weasley about following Malfoy and asks him to check the manor, he tells McGonagall that he thinks Malfoy is behind the Katie attack (he even admits to McGonagall that he followed Malfoy to Borgin and Burkes) and he even reiterates his suspicions to Dumbledore. Even though he embarrasses his own friends with his suspicions, he is not deterred from letting adults know what he considers a threat. 

5. **Advocacy for Stan Shunpike**

Harry's anger and advocacy for Stan Shunpike, people Scrimgeour is throwing to Azkaban on false charges. He would have felt upset about it regardless, but Sirius' false imprisonment is a powerful factor in how he feels about these things. (He also notes Slughorn's cosseted existence with disdain: ""it was hard to sympathise with Slughorn's cosseted existence when he remembered Sirius, living in cave and eating rats).

6. **The Mundungus scene**

 The most explicit show of Harry's feelings about Sirius' death comes in full force in the scene with Mundungus outside of Hog's Head. His grief manifests in precise, focused rage in this chilling scene: 

*Harry had pinned Mundungus against the wall of the pub by the throat. Holding him fast with one hand, he pulled out his wand*.

Why do I call it a focused, precise rage? Mostly, because unlike the other times Harry is provoked with perceived disrespect to a dead parent, Harry has not forgotten his wand. (Cue the scene in OOTP that he is so angry he just beats up Malfoy with his fists).  What Harry has done is not just grab him by the throat, he makes sure Mundungus (who is shorter than him) is nose to nose with him and *then* threatens him with a wand. 

“*You took that from Sirius’s house*,” *said Harry, who was almost nose to nose with Mundungus and was breathing in an unpleasant smell of old tobacco and spirits*. “*That had the Black family crest on it*.”/ ""*What did you do, go back the night he died and strip the place*?""

And he doesn't stop until Tonks magically throws him off Mundungus.

""*Harry, you mustn’t*!” *shrieked Hermione, as Mundungus started to turn blue*.

*There was a bang, and Harry felt his hands fly off Mundungus’s throat*. *Gasping and spluttering, Mundungus seized his fallen case, then — CRACK — he Disapparated*.

*Harry swore at the top of his voice, spinning on the spot to see where Mundungus had gone*.

A small tangent -  It is not a coincidence that we see Harry's darker and more chilling traits in a book where he is heavily paralleled with Tom Riddle. The parallel is explicit in the scene where he uses his mother's death to guilt Slughorn into giving him the memory. But here is a tiny mention of how Tom Riddle reacts to perceived disrespect to an heirloom from his parent:

*That’s right!*” *said Hepzibah, delighted, apparently, at the sight of Voldemort gazing at her locket, transfixed*. “*I had to pay an arm and a leg for it, but I couldn’t let it pass, not a real treasure like that, had to have it for my collection*. *Burke bought it, apparently, from a ragged-looking woman who seemed to have stolen it, but had no idea of its true value*— ”

*There was no mistaking it this time: Voldemort’s eyes flashed scarlet at the words, and Harry saw his knuckles whiten on the locket’s chain*.

There is a parallel, not exactly a neat one - but still quite telling that Harry specifically notices how Voldemort's knuckles whiten around the locket, after Hepzibah pretty much talks about how Merope was essentially robbed. Harry understands, in so many ways than one. 

As Ron points out in DH: ""You really understand him"" and Harry responds with ""Bits of him."""
817,1685591476.0,HarryPotterBooks,"Anyone else notice this in GoF? - I can’t believe it took me this long to realize this, many of you have probably already figured it out. Anyway, here we go:

I am rereading the series for the first time in about 5 years, and I just realized something in the fourth book. After the Yule ball, Harry, Ron, and Hermione are walking in to Hogsmeade. As they’re walking, they see Krum come out of the ship on the lake and watch him dive in to the water. This obviously causes the trio to comment on it, and the speculate if he is used to the cold water or if he’s just mad. However, the readers find out later that he tries to change into a shark in the second task. Krum had probably figured out the egg and was out there practicing! Also, seeing as how the second task was in February, the water was bound to be freezing so it’s not a bad idea to start getting used to the cold water before the task itself, which would give him an edge. I just thought this was an interesting detail JKR put in there. Page 443 for reference if anyone’s curious.

Edit: page 443 in the paperback version that I have. Should get you close I think but it’s on the way into Hogsmeade after Christmas but before Harry figures out his egg"
818,1685581308.0,HarryPotterBooks,"Why did Dumbledore prevent Snape from being DADA teacher? - For most of the series, Snape being prevented from DADA is described as preventing him from getting to close to the Dark Arts (noting the narration from Harry’s perspective could also explain the focus on this). But I just realised that Dumbledore knew of the curse on the DADA position, and likely didn’t want to risk something happening to Snape in the role until he had no choice, and/or he knew his death was near. Thoughts?

Note - I wanted to keep the fact Snape becomes DADA teacher out of the heading for those still reading the series."

I imagine them to both have passed away by the time Harry and Dudley are 6 years old.

820,1685487851.0,HarryPotterBooks,"“Black stopped dead. It would have been impossible to say which face showed more hatred.” - I was re-reading Prisoner of Azkaban the other day and found this really interesting line. It's referring to when Snape has apprehended Sirius and Lupin at the Shrieking Shack and is advancing upon Sirius.

So, it's clear why Snape hates Sirius; he thinks he betrayed the Order and sold Lily out to Voldemort, resulting in her death (& 13 more deaths to boot); at this point, Sirius is the only other person Snape can blame for Lily’s death & an thus an outlet for his own self-hatred. On top of all this emotional baggage, he is convinced Sirius is targeting Harry Potter, whom he's trying to protect. He isn't alone here—everyone from Dumbledore to the Minister to Arthur Weasley believes this to be true. Oh, *and* Sirius used to torment him and almost got him killed/seriously injured in school.

So... why does *Sirius* hate *Snape* so much? It's not because Sirius thinks or knows that he was a Death Eater; in fact, in GOF Sirius says he doesn't think it's likely that Snape was one.

It’s almost laughable to equate the hatred both feel when when Snape has so many more reasons to hate Sirius at this moment than Sirius has to hate Snape. So what is this line trying to tell us? Here are my thoughts, but please let me know yours!

1. It establishes one of the first parallels between Snape and Sirius, setting up the adulthood rivalry that we will see play out over the course of the next few books. It trains the reader to look for similarities in these two characters who are often at odds.

2. It shows us just how emotionally stunted Sirius is after years in Azkaban. He has a one-track mind, and his emotions are all-encompassing. His enemies aren’t human; they’re “vermin” and “filth”. At this point, he has very little capacity for nuance. He’ll grow over the next few books due to his relationship with Harry, which brings out his humanity, but he never quite re-evaluates his attitude towards Snape. His hatred of Snape, especially at this moment, is reflexive, not rational.

3. It hints at Sirius's complicated relationship with his family. There seems to be something about Snape that triggers Sirius, and we learn later that Snape likely uncomfortably reflects back to Sirius the path his family had expected and pressured him to follow. Snape embraces and represents Slytherin, a house which is used several times in the books as shorthand for the Black family’s values. Sirius's hatred and bullying might have been an externalization of the struggle he himself faced between his family’s values and his own, and possibly to repudiate nagging doubts that he wouldn’t escape his family’s influence.

4. It casts doubt on Lupin and Harry’s interpretation of Snape’s motives stemming from a “schoolboy grudge”. I mean, Sirius hates the memory of an unpleasant, interfering, unpopular teen with an interest in the dark arts as much as Snape hates the adult traitor & mass-murderer he thinks is standing in front of him.

We're introduced to Rita right after the world cup when Mr. Weasley was reading about the bungle at the quidditch cup and he's like ""who wrote this.. ah Rita, should have known."" And Percy mentions that Rita has it in for the ministry. So this is clearly a known thing, that her writing isn't to be trusted.

Amos gets on Harry about Rita's article about the champions, Mrs. WEASLEY reminds him that Rita likes to stir crap up and Amos should know that working for the ministry. 

Within the same chapter we get Mrs. Weasley being a tool to Hermione. She'd sent her a tiny chocolate egg for Easter when the boys got dragon egg sized ones. And why? Cause Mrs. Weasley believed Rita in her Witch Weekly article....

* To tell Uncle Vernon and Aunt Petunia that Dudley is an unpopular loser like they are
* Harry to punch Uncle Vernon’s face during the strangling
* After Uncle Vernon and Aunt Petunia’s unison ”SHUT UP!”, Harry does the same to them too and calls Uncle Vernon a fat boy and Aunt Petunia ugly

Currently on HBP and every time Harry has to go somewhere it seems he considers running into Peeves or indeed meets him. Also when we are given a description of the overall mood of the students at Hogwarts Peeves is often mentioned. Currently Harry is rushing to meet Dumbledore having received his urgent note and bumps into the poltergeist, who throws chalk at him before disappearing. This seems somewhat pointless to add into the story, but given that details of Peeves akin to this are so frequently added there must be some point, or symbolism related to him? 

What do you think the purpose of him is?

830,1685267151.0,HarryPotterBooks,"Do you think there are similarities in the difficult choices Dumbledore feels he needs to take to protect Harry and Sirius in book 5? - I think he is in a very difficult position. He has to compartmentalise things and the most important thing is their safety. That is why Harry has to go back to Privet Drive, why he avoids looking at him to protect him and he sees Grimmauld place as safest for Sirius. . I think all these decisions are difficult for him and he doesn’t like doing it but it needs be done for their safety. However good his intentions are though they impact Harry and Sirius’s frame of mind as Sirius hates being shut up in a house filled with unhappy memories and being unable to help the Order and Harry doesn’t know why Dumbledore won’t look at him. I think it all comes to a head in the Lost Prophecy where you can see he has done everything he thought best to protect them but things have still ended so painfully (there is a lot of guilt and inner regret) and he needs to rebuild his relationship with Harry which he does after apologising and explaining things.

I think she is worried about the toll of being in trapped in this house is doing to Sirius and she feels for him and how lonely and unhappy he is but that maybe makes her be more cautious about some of his advice. Also she doesn’t want Harry to have even more worries that he is carrying so I think that also plays into it. Hermione is very perceptive and emotionally intelligent so I am sure she has thought deeply about how all the trauma he has been through has deeply impacted Sirius.

Surely he was a powerful and talented enough wizard to repair it himself.

The question led me to another one - was the advancement in spell technology not sufficient to do a good job at the time?

I just finished reading POA and noticed in chapter 18 on page 352 that Lupin says, “The potion that Professor Snape has been making for me is a very recent discovery. It makes me safe, you see. As long as I take it in the week preceding the full moon, I keep my mind when I transform…”

In the following chapter on page 358, Snape follows them into the shrieking shack and says “I’ve just been to your office, Lupin. You forgot to take your potion tonight, so I took a gobletful along.” 

Fast forward to chapter 20 on page 380, Hermione says “He didn’t take his potion tonight! He’s not safe!” as Lupin proceeds to turn into a werewolf. 

My question is, how does Lupin turn into a werewolf on a full moon if that same night he was supposed to be taking the potion that works a week before the full moon? 

Either the full moon was supposed to occur a week later, or Snape was giving him the potion a week too late, correct?

I really like her depictions of [Voldemort, Dumbledore](https://media.harrypotterfanzone.com/36-the-only-one-he-ever-feared.jpg), [Ron, and Hermione](https://media.harrypotterfanzone.com/21-the-unknowable-room.jpg).

Very recently, I came across Arch Apolar's illustrations for a new Thai edition. His portrayal of [young Voldemort](https://cdna.artstation.com/p/assets/images/images/026/173/904/large/arch-apolar-92319689-141172697420402-3760837251739680768-o.jpg?1588086707) definitely grew on me. Although a little embellished, Apolar's [Harry](https://cdna.artstation.com/p/assets/images/images/026/192/090/large/arch-apolar-92660747-142322273972111-1932711798318825472-o.jpg?1588135997) is also pretty close to how I see him, with proper black hair and green eyes.

(On a somewhat relevant note, I love GrandPré for drawing [Harry and Lily](https://media.harrypotterfanzone.com/34-the-forest-again.jpg) for ""The Forest Again"".

841,1685009073.0,HarryPotterBooks,"Deathly Hallows symbolizing each of the trio - I have seen loads of theories that the Hallows are supposed to symbolize different characters including the trio before but I just thought of a way I don't think I have seen before so I thought I would run it past you guys. 

Firstly the Elder wand, I think this could represent Harry in DH, I know that he is often tied to the cloak but throughout DH the focus is constantly on Harry's wand, the connection between the cores (plus the protection that gives) and the inevitability that at the end of the book Harry must end up dueling Voldemort. Voldemort is constantly brooding about the Elder wand and when Harry finds out about it, he is obsessed with finding it.  And ultimately Harry wins the allegiance of the wand and it's this that ultimately means his victory against Voldemort. 

Then I think the Resurrection Stone is a symbol for Ron (even though I think he is usually tied to the wand). This is because constantly he is the one that can't accept that people are dead even when the evidence is very strongly for that and as a result constantly theorizes that people are still alive. He was told Mad-Eye was hit by the killing curse and fell off his broom (without a wand) so the chances of his survival was nil, then later he thinks Dumbledore might still be alive even though he died in the basically the same way as Moody and saw his body. So as it's like he expects them to have a power to evade death in a manner similar to the stone. 

And finally, Hermione is the Invisibility Cloak. Ignotus is always depicted as the wisest and most intelligent of the Peverell brothers and there is no denying Hermione is the same in the Golden Trio. However, I think there is more than just intelligence linking her to Ignotus and the cloak, of the trio she is always the one that is most adamant that they should remain invisible. It's pretty much exclusively her that put the protective/invisibility enchantments on the tent. She also is the one that is last to accept that the cloak is not necessary such as during her and Harry's trip to Godric's Hollow, they used polyjuice potion so didn't look like themselves, so the cloak wasn't massively necessary. She also is the one that comes up with smart plans to protect the Trio from the death eaters through use of the cloak."

In PS, Quirrel/Voldemort tells Harry that they tried to kill him in his first Quidditch match, and that without Snape’s counter curse, they would have succeeded. To the best of my knowledge, this fact is never mentioned again. 

We come to a discussion about Snape working to Voldemort many times in the series, and people are often trying to talk Harry down. (Pre DH) Wouldn’t bringing this event up be a GREAT way to do that? “But Harry, don’t you remember when Snape saved your life in your first Quidditch match?” 

I feel like it’s such a key character moment for Snape that is never acknowledged again, despite being something that would have relevance. It seems that most of Snape’s better deeds (This, warning the Order in OotP, etc) are always overlooked. 

Personally I think it’s a cheap plot choice to ignore these moments, in order to try and make Snape’s ‘reveal’ more impactful, but I’m interested to hear what other people think?"

Admittedly, he spotted Crabbe and Goyle moving around the castle on their own more often than usual, sometimes remaining stationary in deserted corridors, but at these times Malfoy was not only nowhere near them, but impossible to locate on the map at all.”

Deserted corridorS plural. 

Is JK just completly making up that they standing in multiple corridors as a red herring for the readers? (Is that allowed in writing?)

Or is this Harry's careless perseption of the map with him somehow failing to notice its always exactly the same corridor? If so, we are expected to believe Harry now being in his 6th year and knowing the school like the back of his hand, on top of frequently visiting this exact corridor his previous year, furthermore becoming obsessive and highly suspicious of malfoys secret activies, he wouldn't immediately recognise the significance of this corridor and its particular powers. Ridiculous!

In Snape's eyes this is obviously unforgivable and probably his hatred for him has only strengthened over the years.
It is understandable that, when he found him in front of Sirius, he did not want to hear reason. He just wanted revenge. And it was easier to believe that the kids who bullied him at school were the bad guys than to hear another explanation.

Snape is still a shitty person but it's interesting to analyze where certain hateful behaviors of him come from."

I can't remember which chapter but, its the one where Harry overhears the conversation about Sirius Killing Peter Pettigrew.

It then goes on to say that Sirius started to laugh like a Maniac after he apparently killed Peter and like 12 others.

This doesn't make sense to me as Sirius does not seem like the kind of person to do that:

For one thing, the person he was trying to go after was a marauder. We already know they were close friends in school.

Another, James and lily had literally just been killed and Harry had been left orphaned.

After seeing someone else kill 13 people, the natural reaction is to look absolutely distraught or something.

The only was that I can think of is that sirius either had a breakdown at the crime scene or, the story of him laughing started as a rumour and was just thought of as fact. 
Over embellishing the story would make him seem more evil. 

I have a strong suspicion Rita Skeeter could have been behind the rumour. As we know, she was already working a reporter around the time due to the capture of Barty Crouch Jr.
We also know that she often embellished events after Harry's interviews from GoF.

As an illegal animagus who was undiscovered at the time, it would have been easy to spread the rumour and embellish the events.

After all, only other people talk about sirius laughing. We never hear Sirius

He eventually let Hagrid take him under Dumbledore’s orders. 

Do you think Sirius would have still tried to get revenge on Pettigrew if he ended up being allowed to take Harry that night? Obviously he was filled with remorse and rage, but I think having Harry would have made Sirius less rash. 

Later in the series Sirius sees James in Harry and that led to him divulging Order secrets and plans to Harry and his friend. Sirius was all for Harry joining the order. I think if Sirius raised Harry from the beginning they would have a real father/son relationship and Sirius would not have been so keen on letting Harry join the order. I think that in this scenario Sirius would be a lot more like Molly then the Sirius we got.

885,1684244846.0,HarryPotterBooks,"I love how these two passages link to each other - >Harry and Ron went slowly upstairs to their dormitory. As Harry pulled on his pajamas, he looked over at Neville’s bed. True to his word to Dumbledore, he had not told Ron and Hermione about Neville’s parents. As Harry took off his glasses and climbed into his four-poster, he imagined how it must feel to have parents still living but unable to recognize you. He often got sympathy from strangers for being an orphan, but as he listened to Neville’s snores, he thought that Neville deserved it more than he did. Lying in the darkness, Harry felt a rush of anger and hate toward the people who had tortured Mr. and Mrs. Longbottom. ... He remembered the jeers of the crowd as Crouch’s son and his companions had been dragged from the court by the dementors. ... He understood how they had felt. ... Then he remembered the milk-white face of the screaming boy and realized with a jolt that he had died a year later.  
>  
>**It was Voldemort, Harry thought, staring up at the canopy of his bed in the darkness, it all came back to Voldemort. ... He was the one who had torn these families apart, who had ruined all these lives. ...** (GoF)

This probably is my favorite instance of Harry's righteous anger. He saw well beyond what Voldemort did to the Potters. It also shows Harry's boundless compassion. While he felt deeply for the Longbottoms, he also felt for the terrible cohort of Death Eaters who broke Neville's family apart--who were led astray and ""enabled"" by Voldemort. He gave even them the benefit of the doubt.

Later, Harry took note of Dumbledore's ""tendency to trust people in spite of overwhelming evidence that they did not deserve it"" (HBP). Harry had the tendency to try and forgive people in spite of overwhelming evidence that they did not deserve it. Dumbledore was the ""champion of commoners, of Mudbloods and Muggles"" (GoF), whereas Harry was the champion of literally everyone.

>Harry glanced again at the raw-looking thing that trembled and choked in the shadow beneath the distant chair.  
>  
>“Do not pity the dead, Harry. Pity the living, and, above all, those who live without love. **By returning, you may ensure that fewer souls are maimed, fewer families are torn apart.** If that seems to you a worthy goal, then we say good-bye for the present.” (DH)

Harry finally had the power to put an end to Voldemort's self-destruction and destruction of other people's lives and society at large. So satisfying to read!"
886,1684189805.0,HarryPotterBooks,"Fudge was not as scared in dealing with a potential war with Voldemort as he was of being exposed for his blunder with regards to Sirius Black - For me books 3 and 4 always read like a two-parter. In book 3 we don't really have a villain (unless you consider the Dementors who were still acting at the time according to what they were supposed to do) and most of the conflict remains unresolved - Sirius is on the run and Pettigrew escapes thus fulfilling Trelawney's prophecy and book 4 takes on from there.

We also see in book 3, during his conversation with the teachers and Rosmerta, that Fudge is fully aware Voldemort is alive and (incorrectly) believes Sirius could bring him back:

> ‘But what do you think he’s broken out to do?’ said Madam Rosmerta. ‘Good gracious, Minister,
he isn’t trying to rejoin You-Know-Who, is he?’

> ‘I daresay that is his – er – eventual plan,’said Fudge evasively. ‘But we hope to catch Black long
before that. I must say, You-Know-Who alone and friendless is one thing … but give him back his
most devoted servant, and I shudder to think how quickly he’ll rise again …’

Now of course we know that at the end Sirius escapes from right under the Minister's nose, he is forced to withdraw the Dementors from the school and Sirius allows himself to be seen somewhere in the south of England in order for the Ministry to reduce their resources searching for him around Hogwarts.

But then you have two international events happening in your country: the Quidditch World Cup and the Triwizard Tournament. Most resources have to go into that and you don't really want to advertise that you have Voldemort's right hand man on the loose. So probably the hunt for Sirius is toned down and probably in time even forgotten of. But both events end up in major fuck ups: the Dark Mark is cast over the camping site and a student dies.

Now Fudge thinks that if he admits Voldemort is back it will result in him being kicked out of the office because of his fuck up with regards to Sirius Black. As the passage above shows us, it's not that Fudge did not believe in the possibility of Voldemort having actually returned indeed, but instead banked on the idea that Voldemort would still rely on his secrecy MO and let the next minister be the one to deal with the issues when his term is over.

So no amount of memories in the Pensieve or Veritaserum would have convinced him to accept Voldemort's return because he already knew that what Harry and Dumbledore were saying could very likely be true. He just made a political move and refused to deal with it out of fear that his reputation might be tarnished with another fuck up.

What are your thoughts?"
887,1684184606.0,HarryPotterBooks,"What do you think Voldemort would think of Dolores Umbridge? - Just for fun, imagine a scenario where they crossed paths or Dolores was mentioned to Voldemort by a death eater. How would he feel about her? Would he find her useful, or as annoying as everyone else finds her?"
888,1684162046.0,HarryPotterBooks,"Dumbledore and Reflections of Himself - I am in the middle of an HBP reread and boy do I have feelings about Dumbledore and Tom Riddle's first meeting.

We see that Mrs Cole piques Dumbledore's interest by mentioning that Tom is a bully, but that doesn't immediately dictate Dumbledore's conduct in the room.  When Tom first commands: ""Tell the truth!"" (a behaviour Harry considers shocking), Dumbledore's move is to remain unfazed and pleasant. Something that makes Tom warier (Tom senses that he has met an adult who would not only not react to him, but will act like he is unaffected by him, the boy who wants to be special).  It establishes the push and pull in the scene, where Tom tries to take control of the scene (as much as a 11 year old child can) and Dumbledore consistently undercuts it.

The scene changes in tone when Dumbledore reveals that Tom is magical, and I find Dumbledore's reaction to Tom's response so *interesting*:

>“I knew I was different,” he whispered to his own quivering fingers. “I knew I was special. Always, I knew there was something.”

“Well, you were quite right,” said Dumbledore, **who was no longer smiling, but watching Riddle intently**. “You are a wizard.”

Why does Dumbledore, who was perfectly happy to smile pleasantly and weather through Tom's wariness and suspicion, suddenly become more intent and unsmiling? It is because he understands Tom's need to be ""special"", a reflection of his youthful self who felt bitterness and resentment when he was responsible for his family.

Here is Dumbledore, in a confession of his greatest mistakes to Harry in Deathly Hallows: ""**I was gifted, I was brilliant. I wanted to escape. I wanted to shine. I wanted glory.""**

The scene progresses, and Tom asks Dumbledore to prove that he is a wizard in the same commanding tone: ""Prove it!""

Dumbledore, who has become fraction colder, merely raises his eyebrows and insists that Tom uses respectful honorifics in addressing him (""Then you will address me as professor or sir""). And then Tom in ""an unrecognizably polite voice"" which Dumbledore (and Harry who is watching the memory) recognises as non-apologetic way of getting what he wants.

Then Dumbledore does something that establishes his total domination in the scene, something he admits to Tom later: ""“The time is long gone when I could frighten you with a burning wardrobe and force you to make repayment for your crimes. But I wish I could, Tom. ... I wish I could. ...”

He burns Tom's wardrobe, and unnerves him with proof of his thievery.  This is the only time in the scene Tom is cornered, and I don't think he ever forgets how Dumbledore made him feel(and why Dumbledore is the ""only one he ever feared""):

>Open the door,” said Dumbledore.  
>  
>Riddle hesitated, then crossed the room and threw open the wardrobe door. On the topmost shelf, above a rail of threadbare clothes, a small cardboard box was shaking and rattling as though there were several frantic mice trapped inside it.  
>  
>“Take it out,” said Dumbledore.  
>  
>(...)  
>  
>  
>  
>“Is there anything in that box that you ought not to have?” asked Dumbledore.  
>  
>Riddle threw Dumbledore a **long, clear, calculating look**. “Yes, I suppose so, sir,” he said finally, in an expressionless voice.  
>  
>“Open it,” said Dumbledore.

Dumbledore admits to Harry that what made him uneasy about Tom was ""obvious instincts for cruelty, secrecy and domination."" (He does become gentle with Tom when Tom expresses desire to know his parentage, and the gentleness is remarked on in the scene).

But, like I demonstrated with wardrobe burning, there is no scene in the books where Dumbledore is not in control, even when he appears not to be (whenever someone makes the mistake of assuming as such, as Draco in the climax of the book - ""**you’re in my power. ... I’m the one with the wand. ... You’re at my mercy**"", Dumbledore reminds him: ""**It is my mercy, not yours that matters now**."")

That's not the first of Dumbledore's reflection. Who else has instincts for secrecy, like Tom Riddle?

>“I knew my brother, Potter. He learned secrecy at our mother’s knee. **Secrets and lies, that’s how we grew up, and Albus ... he was a natural**.”

What Dumbledore fears, what Dumbledore is wary of, what Dumbledore *cannot forgive* are reflections of himself in another person (""Was I better, ultimately, than Voldemort?"" he asks in DH). And this is entirely because Dumbledore cannot forgive himself for what happened to his family - his indifference to who Grindelwald was, his hubris that cost him his sister.

It is exactly why he is also surprised (and taken aback) at Harry's empathy for his parent's murderer: ""Could you possibly be feeling sorry for Lord Voldemort?"" (it is also where his respect and love for Harry comes from: ""I've known for sometime, you are a better man"")

We see this even in Harry's attempt to save Voldemort's soul (""Try for some remorse, I've seen what you will be otherwise""), whereas Dumbledore is more unforgiving of Voldemort's final fate (""You cannot help"" Dumbledore says to Harry).  It tallies well with what he tells Voldemort in OOTP:

>“We both know that there are other ways of destroying a man, Tom,” Dumbledore said calmly. “**Merely taking your life would not satisfy me, I admit** — ”

“There is nothing worse than death, Dumbledore!” snarled Voldemort.

“You are quite wrong,” said Dumbledore. “Indeed, your failure to understand that there are things much worse than death has always been your greatest weakness — ”

Voldemort's final fate, a mutilated soul that is stuck in King cross limbo, unable to go on is the fate ""worse than death"" that Dumbledore is referring to. It is the fate Harry tries to save Voldemort from, by asking him to repair his soul with ""remorse.""

# Remorse

I would be remiss to not talk about another young wizard that Dumbledore reacts quite personally to - young, wayward Death Eater Severus Snape. u/manuelestavillo had made a lovely observation in one of his metas about how Dumbledore's response to Snape: ""You disgust me"" is far more personal than him reacting to someone like Fenrir Greyback.

Snape's indifference to evil, his hunger for power (the trait that made him join Death Eaters and follow Voldemort ) ""disgusts"" Dumbledore.  For Dumbledore, he has gotten his sister killed because of his own refusal to listen to his conscience, his passion for Grindelwald that led to poor judgement: ""Did I know, in my heart of hearts, what Gellert Grindelwald was? **I think I did, but I closed my eyes**. If the plans we were making came to fruition, **all my dreams would come true**.""

He sees the same indifference and selfishness in Snape at the beginning of his arc: ""You do not care about the lives of her husband and child? They can die, as long as you can have what you want?""

Snape, of course, grows into someone Dumbledore relies on (""*How many people have you watched die?"" ""Lately those who I cannot save""*), someone Dumbledore considers redeemed with his casual: ""*You are a braver man by far than Igor Karkaroff. You know, I sometimes think we Sort too soon ...*""

Which brings me to the most commonly misunderstood/ poorly analysed scene in Deathly Hallows:

>From the tip of his wand burst the silver doe: She landed on the office floor, bounded once across the office, and soared out of the window. Dumbledore watched her fly away, and as her silvery glow faded he turned back to Snape, and his eyes were full of tears.  
>  
>“After all this time?”  
>  
>“Always,” said Snape.

This is not Snape's declaration of romantic love - it is declaration of his guilt that will forever haunt him, his role in Lily's death that he wants to atone for. He was protecting Harry out of remorse, and he gives up this very personal desire for atonement in service of ""greater good"" to defeat Voldemort - by passing on the knowledge that Dumbledore gave him to Harry.

Dumbledore's own reaction - his tears- aren't because he is moved by Snape's undying love. It's because, once again, Dumbledore sees a reflection of himself, of his own guilt, his self-inflicted tragedies in Snape.  He is moved because Snape was ""never free"", like himself. As Harry astutely reads Dumbledore's painful guilt:

>“ ’Course, Grindelwald scarpered. He had a bit of a track record already, back in his own country, and he didn’t want Ariana set to his account too. And Albus was free, wasn’t he? Free of the burden of his sister, free to become the greatest wizard of the — ”  
>  
>“**He was never free,**” said Harry.  
>  
>“I beg your pardon?” said Aberforth.  
>  
>“Never,” said Harry. “The night that your brother died, he drank a potion that drove him out of his mind. He started screaming, pleading with someone who wasn’t there. **‘Don’t hurt them, please ... hurt me instead.’** ”

Keeping ""Hurt me instead"" in mind, here is how Dumbledore offers a way forward for the self-destructive, guilt-ridden Severus Snape:

>""I wish ... I wish / were dead. ...”  
>  
>“**And what use would that be to anyone?**” said Dumbledore coldly. “If you loved Lily Evans, if you truly loved her, then **your way forward is clear**.”

Dumbledore understands this self-destructive, suicidal guilt very intimately and very personally, and he is harsher and colder with Snape as he is with himself. (He also interestingly, never magically fixes the crooked nose - a mark of his brother's blame at their sister's funeral) Dumbledore, as Hermione notes in the scene with Harry, ""Maybe he did believe these things when he was seventeen, but the whole of the rest of his life was devoted to fighting the Dark Arts!""

What use, indeed his own guilt, if he doesn't fight for the Greater Good?

This is reflected in the quotation he chose for his mother and sister's grave:

>Harry stooped down and saw, upon the frozen, lichen-spotted granite, the words KENDRA DUMBLEDORE and, a short way below her dates of birth and death, AND HER DAUGHTER ARIANA. There was also a quotation: **Where your treasure is, there will your heart be also.**"

He said “for the first time in his life, he wanted his wand back in his hand, not to defend himself, but to attack…to kill” (339). Just as Harry couldn’t pull off a proper Cruciatus Curse in OotP (as as Moody says in GoF), I doubt Harry would be capable of actually murdering him. 

But at that point in the narrative, Harry legitimately didn’t know HOW one killed a person with magic. He had no idea the spell was called Avada Kedavra—he just knew there was green light. So what could he have even done to Sirius? Oh, I know there are other spells that can hurt/kill someone, but there’s no indication anywhere up to that point that angry, 13-year-old Harry knows any of them. So what was he gonna do?

I feel like Snape may have only told DD about it and everyone else involved (Harry and his closest friends and Malfoy) just kept their mouths shut. I'm not sure why Malfoy and his mother kept their mouths shut because they could get Harry expelled by complaining, but it's probably because they don't want to draw attention to themselves. They're already in hot water because of Lucius being a known death eater. At this point, most people would probably think Harry ""the chosen one"" was just forced to drastically defend himself against the death eater's son Malfoy.  
  
But it is obvious that the entire school is NOT whispering about the incident, so I think it was kept very, very quiet. Normally, the entire school gossips like crazy about everything Harry gets in trouble for each year.

Make it look like an accident instead of Harry etc. The Malfoys are no longer popular or have the power to do anything, and LV assigned Draco his mission to get Draco killed anyway. So literally nobody cares at this point if Malfoy dies OR they don't have the power to do much about it (such as his parents).  
  
So it ultimately didn't matter if Harry hid the book or gave it up to Snape, if he killed Malfoy or didn't. The entire incident would have been kept quiet no matter what. Snape just wanted his book back and to punish Harry in the only way he could. Harry just wanted to keep the book.  
  
If I were writing Harry Potter, I absolutely would have had Malfoy die at Harry's hand by accident. mwahahaha! But this is a children's book and it's not allowed to get that dark and morally grey. Harry should have been a much darker character just from the results of the Dursley's childhood abuse.

It also makes you wonder that, **at this point in the timeline,** what could have Harry gotten away with? Murder? and DD/Snape would have helped to cover it up because they need their ""chosen one"" to defeat LV? Or only because it was the murder of a Slytherin? If Harry had killed an innocent Hufflepuff, then what? Does DD just kill Harry-the-horcrux himself and then go kill LV? It feels like DD's plan was as convoluted as it was because he was trying to give Harry a chance to survive and only kill the horcrux part. If Harry is deemed too evil to be the ""chosen one"" anymore, just let Snape or any random deatheater take care of the Horcrux-inside-Harry problem."

895,1683884571.0,HarryPotterBooks,"Why was Harry so determined to hide the Prince’s potions book? - Ok, he has just used Sectusempra on Malfoy. Snape has just found him having maimed and/or tried to gruesomely kill someone. He asks him to go get his books. Harry frantically tells Ron to give him his potion book so he can keep the Prince’s book, which he hides in the RoR…

So he wanted to keep being top in potions/learning things from the Prince, and I know Snape would’ve punished him terribly either way I suppose, but still, I see two options here.

**1. Hand over the book.** ‘I’m so sorry, I didn’t know what the spell did, I got this book and it’s been really helpful so I didn’t think this would happen’

Outcome: no longer best in potions, but also not a gruesome murderer who knowingly used dark magic to kill someone. Much less likely to be expelled.

**2. What Harry did, hiding the Prince’s book and showing Ron’s book to Snape.** ‘No, no, this is really my book! Yes, I really, genuinely wanted to murder Malfoy. I know you’ve tried to have me expelled for damaging a tree accidentally and other minor things, but I’m confident attempted murder will get me detention only. And then I’ll still be beating Hermione at potions and slughorn will still like me, *teehee*. What, no Quidditch! How could I have foreseen that!’

Outcome: still best in potions, except not really since he’s still hiding the book… but surely most teachers now think he might be the most evil student in the school…


Ok, Snape wasn’t going to be reasonable either way, but I don’t understand why Harry wanted to keep the potions book so much. He had already gotten the memory from Slughorn, so it’s purely that he just liked being the best… but surely he assumed other students and teachers would hear about this. Of course Snape knew about the Prince, but Harry didn’t know that at the time…

Am I forgetting or missing something important?"
896,1683876439.0,HarryPotterBooks,"How human do you think Voldemort is? - I see him as trying to run away from mortality (literally in the name), but things do make him scared (Graveyard, learning his horcruxes are in danger).

We already see in Book 5 that he feels giddy at Podmore's capture, elated when Azkaban breakout occurs and anger at still failing to get the prophecy.

And so, I like to think that he can feel other emotions too. Like:

- Pride, on learning of Hogwarts' deepest secrets. Figuring out flying without brooms. Inventing a potion to bring back his body, and successful execution of the Triwizard plan, and Ministry takeover.

- Pity or sadness, on Snape's death

- loving Bellatrix enough to have a kid, whatever the method.

- and finally Remorse, something he doesn't want to feel as that would destroy his horcrux. This moment comes when Voldemort possesses Harry and wants Dumbledore to kill Harry. Harry feels remorse and Voldemort immediately backs out, as that could destroy a horcux. Something Dumbledore hints in a roundabout way (like he usually does).

899,1683782811.0,HarryPotterBooks,"Thoughts on the epitaph on Ariana Dumbledore's grave? - ""Where your treasure is, there is where your heart will be also.""

I know it's a quote from the Bible but I am wondering whether it has any meaning to the story also. JK rarely mentions any detail that doesn't have some sort of meaning to the plot. 

I always saw the epitaph on the Potters' grave (""The last enemy that shall be defeated is death"") as a foreshadowing that the final confrontation won't be with Voldemort but rather with his own death. Dumbledore also mentions in King's Cross that if Harry returns Voldemort will be defeated for good thus not really creating any tension in the final showdown, not as much as Harry walking to his own death anyways.

While the epitaph on Ariana's grave is pretty straightforward in terms of what it means, I don't really see if it's meant to be some form of advice or some form of foreshadowing or part of  the plot at all. Any thoughts?"
900,1683773042.0,HarryPotterBooks,"Voldemort has severe CPTSD: How nurture (or rather, the lack of) made Voldemort, not nature. [XPOST] - Nature vs Free Will is one of the great debates of our kind, and is one of the core themes of \*Harry Potter\*, as should be a surprise to none of you readers.

  
By the end of the series, it would seem that the question is largely settled in favour of Free Will; Harry consistently and finally chose to be self-sacrificing, good, and brave when he had all the reason not to, whilst Voldemort ultimately chose to pursue Harry to the point of self-defeat, and refused to feel empathy even when it would have saved his immortal soul (while Harry did not exactly given him much time to repent in the final encounter, Voldemort must have known that empathy was supposed to be the antidote to a torn soul, given his mastery of all things Dark and Horcruxy). Ultimately, a major theme in the series is that a person can choose to do what is right, regardless of circumstance, and that person always has that choice. This theme was always clear to me.

  
However, ever since J.K. Rowling famously stated that Voldemort's circumstance of birth (that he was conceived under the influence of a love potion) was symbolic for his lack of love in life, a large contingent of the fanbase believe that he is incapable of love. This errant belief obviously is problematic in the context of series and of the theme of choice and is not supported by the author.

  
However, that this belief spread so widely shows that people did feel sympathy for the circumstances beyond Voldemort's control. What many readers may fail to recognise however, is just how profoundly damaged Voldemort really was.

  
Voldemort is a textbook example of Complex PTSD (CPTSD), fight-trauma type. CPTSD is a more insidious type of PTSD that most often occurs when a person is repeatedly neglected or abused with no option to escape. Since escape is impossible, that person must instead develop coping mechanisms which are necessary in the moment but deeply harmful outside of the trauma-inducing environment. One of the 4 major trauma types is the fight-trauma type, in which a CPTSD sufferer learns to dominate others in order to experience intimacy and interpersonal relationships in a safe, controlled fashion. At its extremes, fight-trauma type turns into full blown Narcissism (in fact there is growing research that suggests that Narcissistic personality disorder is a subset of CPTSD, not a separate disorder). Fight-trauma types may fantasise about domination, control, revenge, and have very extreme surges of rage, fury, anger, hatred and fear when they are triggered (which is most often when they are defied). This sound familiar to anyone?  

CPTSD is at heart caused by emotional neglect, and most strongly occurs when infants are neglected in the first few years of life. Tom Riddle was separated from his mother at birth, and (from what we can see) never or rarely loved as a baby should be: held, kissed, played with, comforted, spoken to, etc, etc. It is impossible to understate how much a baby needs near-constant positive engagement and consequently how damaging it is when a baby is neglected for long periods of time (research shows that neglected babies are much more likely to suddenly die). Tom Riddle obviously received no better treatment as he grew older, and in fact was outcasted by his peers, further stunting his emotional and social development, furthering his CPTSD.  

Unfortunately, wizards must be completely ignorant of mental health because Dumbledore did the worst possible thing when he burnt Tom's wardrobe - he confirmed that people would not accept him for who he truly was, and that power was king. From this point onward, Tom Riddle hid his true self behind a charming facade (as is common with Narcissists), and gave no one any opportunity to see how damaged he really was and so no opportunity to provide intervention by way of therapy. Tom Riddle was set firmly and inexorably on a path that would lead to Voldemort.  

I've recently learned a lot about CPTSD, because I too have found just how well CPTSD fight-type fits me. I've always wondered why I felt a strange attraction to Voldemort, even while his actions have always been abhorrent and unconscionable to me. Now I see that I see myself in him, and feel much more sympathy for him than I ever did before.  

Sadly, for all of Rowling's proclamations on the ultimate power of choice (ironically, most often with Dumbledore's voice, Voldemort's chief enemy), it seems to me that Voldemort didn't really have much of a choice. He was set up to fail from the start. I have seen how much I have struggled with my CPTSD, and my circumstances were much, much better than his. I really don't know if I would have done any better in his shoes, and that's the honest-to-god truth.  

Ultimately, Voldemort was always a tragic figure (recall Dumbledore preaching pity, not hatred), but I hadn't realised just how tragic until now.  

He really never had a chance.

Sorry if anyone feels I misrepresented CPTSD - there are many more ways of reacting to trauma than the fight-trauma type, and most people who experience this type and CPTSD in general are more a danger to themselves than others.

901,1683757743.0,HarryPotterBooks,"Details you only picked up on a re-read - I feel like JK liked to put a lot of things in the books that could only really be noticed or appreciated fully on a re-read.  I'm wondering what everyone else's favorites are and if anyone picked up any I might've missed even.  


A few of my favorites off the top of my head:

* CoS when they are leaving for the train she has to go back because she ""Forgot her Diary""  Was this Riddle's diary?
* PoA:  The sneakoscope that Ron bought for Harry that he thought was just a cheap piece of junk was actually going off because of Peter the entire time.  
* GoF is written as almost a mystery book and is full of them, but my go-to is always the glazed look and odd behavior of Crouch Sr in the room after Harry's name came out.  Like he just idly stands by until he's called upon.  It almost feels like it should have been more suspicious on the first read once you know he's under the Imperius curse here.
* OotP is a small one but I like how Scrimgeour's name gets mentioned by someone during Harry's first dinner at Grimmauld place"
902,1683744483.0,HarryPotterBooks,"I asked AI who was more evil Umbridge or Lucius Malfoy do you agree with the response? - That's a tough question. They were both pretty evil in their own ways, but I would say that Dolores Umbridge was probably worse. While Lucius Malfoy was certainly a bad person who did a lot of terrible things, he was at least somewhat loyal to his family and had some sense of honor. Dolores Umbridge, on the other hand, was completely ruthless and had no qualms about hurting anyone who got in her way. She was a sadistic person who enjoyed inflicting pain on others, and I think she was one of the most evil characters in the entire series."

Just curious"

In CoS, the bludgers are charmed to follow him. In PoA, dementors literally attack him as he falls out of the sky and no one thinks that he maybe shouldn’t be playing Quidditch. The closest we get is McGonagall, saying that Hooch should supervise their training at night in PoA because of Sirius."
906,1683550190.0,HarryPotterBooks,"Don’t call it plot armor; Harry is a great duelist and fighter. He doesn’t survive on exceptional magical ability though, but because he is king of the so-called “intangibles” - Sports writers, in a field dominated by statistics, sometimes talk about the *intangibles*, which are the undefinable or unmeasurable characteristics that can make or break a team. To use basketball as an example, a player may not be the tallest, the best shooter, or the best ball handler, but they may be considered a valuable asset nonetheless. They may have a good hustle, or a certain chemistry that makes the whole team play harder. They may perform better under pressure, or have an indomitable endurance, or the drive to play through a tough injury. It’s not always the top-seeded teams that win championships; sometimes it’s the plucky underdogs that persevere to take home the trophy.
 
Harry is a competent wizard no doubt, and a natural at defensive magic, but that’s not what makes him a high tier duelist. He has other qualities that make him both dangerous and wily, such as his quickness, his boldness, resourcefulness, adaptiveness, physicality, and a steely determination to stay alive and keep fighting. These are traits that Harry picked up early scrapping with Dudley’s gang, or on the quidditch pitch, or from countless encounters with Malfoy.  These experiences informed Harry’s instincts throughout each book, sometimes giving him the edge, and sometimes allowing him to escape death by only a hair’s breadth.
 
Harry is quick, it’s one of the first things we learn about him: 




 > Dudley’s favorite punching bag was Harry, but he couldn’t often catch him. Harry didn’t look it, but he was very fast.




His quick draw is at least as fast as Voldemort, whose spell he met with his own twice:




> *Before Voldemort could stick his snakelike face around the headstone, Harry stood up . . . he gripped his wand tightly in his hand, thrust it out in front of him, and threw himself around the headstone, facing Voldemort.* 




> *Voldemort was ready. As Harry shouted, “Expelliarmus!” Voldemort cried, “Avada Kedavra!”* 




> *A jet of green light issued from Voldemort’s wand just as a jet of red light blasted from Harry’s — they met in midair —* 




And




> *The bang was like a cannon blast, and the golden flames that erupted between them, at the dead center of the circle they had been treading, marked the point where the spells collided.*




 
Harry is bold. He is willing to act decisively, even illegally, to save a precarious situation:
 
> *“Your wand will do, madam,” said the goblin. He held out a slightly trembling hand, and in a dreadful blast of realization Harry knew that the goblins of Gringotts were aware that Bellatrix’s wand had been stolen.*
 
> *“Act now, act now,” whispered Griphook in Harry’s ear, “the Imperius Curse!”*
 
> *Harry raised the hawthorn wand beneath the cloak, pointed it at the old goblin, and whispered, for the first time in his life, “Imperio!”*
 
> *A curious sensation shot down Harry’s arm, a feeling of tingling warmth that seemed to flow from his mind, down the sinews and veins connecting him to the wand and the curse it had just cast.*




He rarely fails to confront a challenge when presented, planning to confront  Draco Malfoy in a wizard's duel even as a totally green first-year (Malfoy does not show up, Harry wins by default).
 
Harry is resourceful. Surrounded at the Department Mysteries, Harry devises a quick stratagem to surprise the Death Eaters:
 
> *The two figures that had burst from the shattered spheres had melted into thin air. Nothing remained of them or their erstwhile homes but fragments of glass upon the floor. They had, however, given Harry an idea. The problem was going to be conveying it to the others.*
 
…
 
> *“Can this be?” said Malfoy, sounding maliciously delighted; some of the Death Eaters were laughing again, and under cover of their laughter, Harry hissed to Hermione, moving his lips as little as possible, “Smash shelves —”[… ]“— when I say go —”*
 
> *“Very good, Potter, very good . . .” said Malfoy slowly. “But the Dark Lord knows you are not unintell —”*
 
> *“NOW!” yelled Harry.*
 
> *Five different voices behind him bellowed “REDUCTO!” Five curses flew in five different directions and the shelves opposite them exploded as they hit. The towering structure swayed as a hundred glass spheres burst apart, pearly-white figures unfurled into the air and floated there, their voices echoing from who knew what long-dead past amid the torrent of crashing glass and splintered wood now raining down upon the floor —*
 
> *“RUN!” Harry yelled, and as the shelves swayed precariously and more glass spheres began to pour from above, he seized a handful of Hermione’s robes and dragged her forward, one arm over his head as chunks of shelf and shards of glass thundered down upon them.*




Harry is very adaptive, the Triwizard Tournament is proof of that. By the end of it Harry has encountered tons of dangerous situations in odd circumstances, underwater or from the air, against creatures and various other magics. 


Harry is prepared to both fight *and* run, at a moment’s notice. He will follow a good plan but he’s not afraid to jump into danger and make plans on the fly, like at the Ministry, or jumping into Hogsmeade in DH.




Harry fights physically, like when he yanks the wands out of Draco’s hands: 




> As Ron ran to pull Hermione out of the wreckage, Harry took his chance: He leapt over an armchair and wrested the three wands from Draco’s grip, pointed all of them at Greyback, and yelled, “Stupefy!” The werewolf was lifted off his feet by the triple spell, flew up to the ceiling, and then smashed to the ground.




He’s aware of his environment, often fighting *through* people, or *after* them, dodging spells the whole way. All he's doing is avoiding Bludgers, all day long, going after the Snitch. 




Most of all, Harry is determined to continue fighting, to the very end, despite all odds:




> *Harry crouched behind the headstone and knew the end had come. There was no hope . . . no help to be had. And as he heard Voldemort draw nearer still, he knew one thing only, and it was beyond fear or reason: He was not going to die crouching here like a child playing hide-and-seek; he was not going to die kneeling at Voldemort’s feet . . . he was going to die upright like his father, and he was going to die trying to defend himself, even if no defense was possible. . . .*




Harry’s reaction towards certain death ends up saving him against even his strongest foe. If he had cowered or fled, he would have been killed with no Priori Incantatem; the choice to fight saved his life in the graveyard. 


Harry is a good wizard, very practiced in a variety of skills, but he's also got the edge in a lot of the intangibles. X-factors. There are reasons he survives crisis after crisis, more than any other character. He's not transcendental in his magical ability, but he's good, and stubborn to lose, and quick to catch others off guard. He does get help, lots of it, and he is saved by luck often, but there is enough evidence to say that Harry is a skilled duelist and fighter."

All these three victims were attacked immediately after.

But then we get Hermione, whom Ginny likely spotted going with Harry in the girls' bathroom several times and she spotted Penelope and Percy snogging. I mean Percy was the only Weasley sibling who showed concern for her throughout the whole year. Could it be likely that she attacked the two girls out of jealousy?

Now I'm not implying that Ginny herself would have attacked the victims but I think it made it a lot easier for Tom to manipulate her into doing it if she complained about them in the diary. She seemed to write enough about Harry so that 16 year Tom got the gist of the situation. So if she wrote ""Mrs. Norris is so horrible. She ratted on Harry and he almost got detention."", ""Colin Creevey is such a prat and a stalker for Harry."", ""Justin Finch-Fletchley has turned the whole school against Harry."", ""Harry is always hanging out with Hermione Granger."", ""I think I lost my big brother to Penelope Clearwater.""

It would have been quite easy for Tom to play on her anger. Of course he probably would not encourage her to attack a pureblood or a teacher despite her witnessing Malfoy being a dick and Snape being unfair to Harry."

Harry gets so much grief for using the sectumsempra curse on Malfoy even though Malfoy was trying to use cruciatus on Harry, but Sirius gets almost no criticism for trying to murder Snape. 

So many people criticise Harry and Ron's friendship(or even Ron and Hermione) because of book 4 and 7 while Marauders are seen as the epitome of frienship even though Sirius used Remus' most vulnerable point as a weapon to murder Snape, Remus thought Sirius betrayed the Potters, Sirius thought Remus was the spy. Say whatever you want about Harry and Ron or Ron and Hermione. None of them thought the other two could be working for voldemort. 

Snape gets pulverized for calling Lily a mudblood once. Then apologising so many times. Draco called Hermione a mudblood in all 5 out of 7 books and so many people think he deserves forgiveness?? 

fans can forgive an adult Remus easily for abandoning his pregnant wife in the middle of a war and needed a 17 year old to shove some sense into him. While teenage Ron is seen as irredeemable for leaving in DH after being manipulated by an evil locket and he didnt need anyone else to shove any sense into him. He regretted the moment he left and wanted to go back. 

Ginny gets maligned for being a fangirl when she was 11. But Hermione gets no hate for being a fangirl of Lockhart? 

Cho gets called a cry baby for crying after her boyfriend got murdered. But Draco gets sympathy for crying in bathroom after his failed attempt to kill his headmaster.

918,1683316560.0,HarryPotterBooks,Do you think Dumbledore felt hurt by the things Harry was yelling at him in the lost prophecy - I think overall he felt really sad and sorry for Harry and an immense amount of guilt for the ways things had unfolded this year and he gave Harry space to vent his rage and grief. I also think he realises Harry isn’t a rational state of mind so doesn’t necessarily mean what he is saying but he is in so much pain and he is hurting. I like the empathy Dumbledore shows Harry in this scene and how he lets him vent and get it out.

She was rather squat with a broad, flabby face, as little neck as Uncle Vernon and a very wide, slack mouth. Her eyes were large, round and slightly bulging. Even the little black velvet bow perched on top of her short curly hair put him in mind of a large fly she was about to catch on a long sticky tongue. 

“The Chair recognizes Dolores Jane Umbridge, Senior Undersecretary to the Minister,” said Fudge. 

The witch spoke in a fluttery, girlish, high-pitched voice that took Harry aback; he had been expecting a croak.

921,1683289059.0,HarryPotterBooks,"A thing that just crossed my mind - Sorry if this has been addressed before but just realized  Hermione sounds like 'ermine' (another name for stoat) and it's probably derived from Hermina/Ermina which was the Latin term for stoat. Since stoats are related to weasels, do you think that was a foreshadowing that Hermione and Ron would end up together? Furthermore the weasels and their relatives tend to feed on snakes... although they are not related to the mongoose or the honey badger which are their most famous predators. 

Another interesting thing is that ferrets (with which Malfoy is associated) are also related to the weasels and the stoats but they are not known as predators to snakes but they are known to kill them occasionally.

Funnily enough I could not identify a connection between Harry and snake predators.

Anyways, what do you think? Is this hidden symbolism or am I reading too much into it?"
922,1683280840.0,HarryPotterBooks,"Slughorn's Foreshadowing - First Lesson - Just listening to Stephen Fry reading HBP. In their first Potions lesson, Slughorn has some potions at the front of the room as discussion points. Among them is Amortentia. When discussing it, Slughorn comments:

> “Amortentia doesn’t really create love, of course. It is impossible to manufacture or imitate love. No, this will simply cause a powerful infatuation or obsession. It is probably the most dangerous and powerful potion in this room — oh yes,” he said, nodding gravely at Malfoy and Nott, both of whom were smirking skeptically. “When you have seen as much of life as I  have, you will not underestimate the power of obsessive love.”

Many times this is mentioned as an allusion to the harm done by Merope, when she bewitched Tom Riddle (soon to be Sr.) Tom Riddle Jr. had his beginning from this obsessive love. And this is all the more so if Dumbledore was correct that Merope used a love potion to ensnare him to begin with, as Slughorn is commenting on the Amortentia.

But... Tom Riddle Jr. also had his **end** through obsessive love. Snape was every bit as important in Voldemort's downfall as was the prophesied ""Chosen One."" And as Voldemort was unable to comprehend the Power of Love in general, we know that he also didn't understand the power of Snape's obsessive love of Lily. 

In the first potions lesson, JKR dropped a pretty substantial hint."

And while Voldemort kind of makes sense as in the 'flight from death' because of his quest to become immortal, the term 'Death Eaters' is even more stupid. It's again just a silly name that tells you 'these people sure are the villains' but it just doesn't make sense. Like why would you eat death? Why would you announce to the world you eat death? And what does it mean to eat death? Like you literally hunt grim reapers and assault them and start chewing on their bones or what? Do you eat poison? But that'd also be pretty dumb.

Any interpretations?"
924,1683221600.0,HarryPotterBooks,"The Diadem could be a wearable Penseive - So this just occured to me, legend says that The Diadem of Ravenclaw contains vast amounts of knowledge and will bestow such knowledge unto it's wearer. I theorize that it goes further and that it's basically a portable, wearable Penseive to whomever touches it, also not just wearing it on your head gives this knowledge, I mean the Opal Necklace was barely brush with Katie's glove, and look what happened, you didn't have to wear it around your neck for it to activate the curse. Now my theory goes a step further and I believe that if you wanted I bet you could also extract memories from it by just asking like when u put your wand to your temple and take one, example: since Voldemort did handle it and contained a part of his soul into the Diadem you could request that the Diadem reveal the locations of the other Horcrux's, suddenly the center jewel glows with a dim white light as it fills up with the memory, u then use your wand to extract it and put into a Penseive or just put on the Diadem to see, although it might be safer to extract the memories since it's also a Horcrux now, but since the corruption has been purged it may be ok to wear if ever properly repaired, what y'all think...

We know that Harry discovered Mrs Figg being related to magic world in order of the Phoenix. But In goblet of fire specifically in Bagman & Crouch chapter there is a hint about Mrs Figg & her possible involvement into magic world.

After building the tent in the quidditch world cup Harry entered the tent. I'm writing the paragraph here..
""Harry bent down, ducked under the tent flap,and felt his jaw drop. He had walked into what looked like an old-fashioned, thre-roomed flat, complete with bathroom and kitchen. Oddly enough, it was furnished in exactly the same sort of style as Mrs Figg's; there were crotcheted covers on the mismatched chairs, and a strong smell of cats.""

There's that flicker of doubt that entered Voldemort. He is intelligent enough to know that Harry could be/is right. For the first time, I thought that possibly his final strike at Harry is somewhat suicidal, rather than pure rage or dismal. He knows it could go either way and at this point so it just doesn't matter,  or even he knows Harry is actally correct in all he has said, which means everything he has built is in ruins and  cannot possibly face up to the ramifications of that? Maybe he knows that striking out at Harry will kill hi and that's the choice he's made.

“He could not let anybody else stand between him and Voldemort; he must abandon forever the illusion he ought to have lost at the age of one, that the shelter of a parent’s arms meant that nothing could hurt him.

934,1683055864.0,HarryPotterBooks,"How Voldy possibly designed the Dark Mark? - Tinfoil flair because this might just be me making a mountain out of a niffler hill... 

On a recent re-listen of CoS I picked up on something that I’m not sure I’ve seen anywhere on the internet, and that I certainly hadn’t thought of before. Feel free to tell me I was today years old when I noticed something super obvious, but hear me out!

When diary-Riddle calls the basilisk, it emerges from the mouth of the stone face of Salazar Slytherin. 

Hearing the passage (he is described as having an ancient and monkey like face) I imagine a gaunt face, with pronounced not-quite-human features. 

This face is carved of stone which in the dim light of a chamber would certainly superficially resemble bone.

I can’t be the only one to think it’s not a stretch to say that it looks like a skull? A skull with a huge great basilisk coming out!

I have to wonder if 15 year old Voldy drew his inspiration from this when designing the image he wanted to brand onto his followers. 

Has anyone else ever picked up on this or am I giving credit to a coincidence?"
935,1683049531.0,HarryPotterBooks,"Book Ranking (based on nothing but vibes) - Hello everyone :)

I just finished my first ever reread of the series! I hadn’t read any of the books since I finished the last book the year it was published - I was 8 in 2007, I’m 24 now so this was not only way overdue, but such a different experience for me obviously since I’m so much older. 

As I was reading I was also keeping up with all the old discussion posts, so that was really fun for me :) 

I wanted to come on here and post my ranking because I don’t have anyone in real life that really cares to talk about this with me that much! Like I said in the title, I’m just basing this off “vibes” lol so to me that means just how much I enjoyed reading it/how hard it hit me emotionally. 

Here’s my ranking :

1.	***Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince*** - this one was my favorite as a child, and I was glad to find that it was just as juicy and dramatic as I remembered. I love when books can actually make me cry, and this one makes me just LOSE it in the end. Plus I was always a fan of Harry/Ginny & Ron/Hermione so the moments we get with both couples in this book have always made me happy. The scene with Harry & Snape at the end where we get the HBP reveal is one of my favorites in the entire series. 

2.	***Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows*** - again I’m crying. I’m an epilogue apologist too 😭. I just love a happy ending and knowing the main couples end up happy and together and sending their kids to Hogwarts… I’m a sucker for that. I just love the way the action happens here, by the time the golden trio makes it back to Hogwarts I’m too hyped to even critique the book. Snape’s death and then the big reveal? Are you kidding??? My favorite thing ever, aside from the golden trio bonding with Kreacher because I just love that for them 

3.	***Harry Potter and the Order of The Phoenix*** - angsty Harry is so fun to read. I have so much sympathy for him in this book and I just really love watching him teach the DA because it’s like the only happiness he gets here. Side characters get more time to shine in this book (Neville, Ginny, & Luna y’all have my heart forever) and the battle at the Ministry is such a wild ride. Dumbledore going up against Voldemort will always be iconic. Umbridge makes me so mad but I love the hell the students start to really put her through so I can deal. 

4.	***Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire*** - just realizing that I have the 4th book ranked 4th lol. I don’t have much to say for this one except I love the mystery surrounding this plot, and this book has so many creepy moments!! Barty Crouch wandering the Hogwarts grounds talking crazy, the ending in the graveyard, (the real) Mad-Eye literally being locked up and hidden away + VOLDEMORT IS BACKKKK!

5.	***Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets*** - I feel like this is where my opinions may start to get more unpopular? This might actually be the creepiest book in the series. It’s very gothic and gives me this certain spooky vibe I can’t really explain. The foreshadowing in this book is literally SO good. Lockhart is hilarious and I love to hate him. 

6.	***Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban*** - this is soooo many people’s favorite, but it isn’t mine and I just can’t put my finger on why. I love the beginning with Harry leaving on the Knight Bus, but for some reason this one is just boring to me in a lot of parts. The ending is really good, I love the meetup in the shrieking shack, maybe it’s the Ron & Hermione arguing that bothers me so much in this one - it goes on forever and I’m just so over it from like the first time it happens. Hermione slapping Draco is definitely a highlight though 

7.	***Harry Potter and the Philosopher’s Stone*** - an amazing entrance into this world, I love the way the golden trio becomes friends, I just think we get better and better as the series goes on. Love the mirror of erised chapter and the ending too, but at the end of the day you can tell this one was written for a more younger audience than the rest. (Imo)


Well that’s it! If you care to, post your own ranking below :) let’s talk about it!"
936,1683031815.0,HarryPotterBooks,"Voldemort and the Chamber of Secrets - Voldemort and the Chamber of Secrets

Does anyone else find it absolutely hilarious that Voldemort had no idea about the events of Chamber of Secrets until he was told the diary was destroyed? 

It cracks me up that his horcrux learn that OG Voldemort “died” at the hands of a baby. It is extra hilarious when you consider how much the events of CoS led to Voldemorts defeat. I get why Voldemort was mad with Lucius!

Lmfaoooo Lucius Malloy and the String of Failures."
937,1682997995.0,HarryPotterBooks,"Do you think Harry’s trust and faith in Dumbledore is restored to the same level it was before in HBP after their conversation in the lost prophecy? - Harry always had a lot of trust and faith in Dumbledore but we see how upset he feels with the way things are between them in OOTP and I think his trust wavers a bit as he doesn’t understand why. After Dumbledore apologises and explains things and their whole conversation in the lost prophecy, I think this is a huge step forward. I think Dumbledore coming to pick him up in book 6, telling off the Dursley’s and including him in things really helps and their relationship is repaired and the level of trust and respect Harry feels for Dumbledore is very high. We see this when he calls himself Dumbledore’s man. I think the difference is though as much as he respects and admires Dumbledore, he doesn’t see him as infallible in the way he did in the first four books."
938,1682996472.0,HarryPotterBooks,I find it interesting that Harry makes his detentions with Umbridge a battle of wills - It is quite sad. Instead of being like this can’t be allowed and I should tell an adult. He probably feels that won’t make a difference and also he is quite angry with Dumbledore at the moment. He makes it into a private battle of wills between him and Umbridge where he is determined not to give her the satisfaction of getting to him. I think he feels he would be weak or admitting defeat if he complained. I think this just shows how used he is to handling adversity on his own and how his pride/ principle of not giving in is all he can cling onto in his own mind while he is suffering this horrific punishment.
939,1682992627.0,HarryPotterBooks,"Something that I just noticed. - James’s Patronus probably was a stag and lilys is a doe. The haunting part is these two animals are often hunted for fun. Just something I noticed and Harry is hunted by Voldemort since the age of one. 

Could Rowling have intended this or no?"
940,1682987238.0,HarryPotterBooks,"Subtle foreshadowing that Madam Rosmerta was under the Imperius curse - This might be stretching ""subtle"" beyond breaking point, but I noticed this one on my most recent re-read - 

“Women,” Ron said wisely to Harry. “They’re easily upset.

“And yet,” said Hermione, coming out of her reverie, “I doubt you’d find a woman who sulked for half an hour because Madame Rosemerta didn’t laugh at their joke about the hag, the Healer, and the Mimbulus mimbletonia.”

In my opinion, it would've been more consistent with Madam Rosmerta's characterisation if she had laughed at Ron's joke, even if it wasn't funny. It's obviously not a huge thing, but enough that on a re-read it sticks out as being a little out of character, and serves a very subtle slice of foreshadowing."
941,1682983967.0,HarryPotterBooks,Author of the Read-Alongs - Anyone else wonder what happened to the read alongs guy who stopped toward the end? I think they’re all amazing and wish he’d been able to complete them. The guys who finished it did a great job but it wasn’t quite the same as his because the bar was so high. I worry what happened because he seemed to have so much passion for the project. I really hope he’s ok! If you’re lurking somewhere mate hope you read this.
942,1682979511.0,HarryPotterBooks,I really like the abandoned boys line in the Forest Again - After seeing Snape’s memories he is able to I think empathise and in some ways relate to him. We have seen through the books many parallels made between Harry and Riddle which Harry has considered uncomfortably at times but I think this is one of the first times we see Harry identifying with Snape except for momentarily after he saw Snape’s Worst Memory. Though I think Harry has more positive memories of Hogwarts than Snape but they both had very difficult childhoods and Hogwarts is an escape from that
943,1682907673.0,HarryPotterBooks,"A thought about Harry and Gringotts - Since Hermione is able to get wizard money in exchange for muggle money (presumably at Gringotts), why didn’t Harry ever exchange some of his wizard money for muggle money so he wasn’t broke all the time?"

I want to see more of what Tom did between leaving school and slowly building up followers. I wanted to see this scene in the movie it was so important and such a shame it was missed.

I also wonder (as I get the sense from this scene) that Voldemort became merciless after this encounter and really ramped up his agenda.

What I love about the series is almost what’s not shown and what’s hinted at with the history of our characters, as much as I love the series itself.

“You returned to me, not out of loyalty, but out of fear of your old friends. You deserve this pain, Wormtail. You know that, don’t you?”

“And I answer myself, perhaps they believed a still greater power could exist, one that could vanquish even Lord Voldemort…perhaps they now pay allegiance to another…perhaps that champion of commoners, of Mudbloods and Muggles, Albus Dumbledore?”

“You all know that on the night I lost my powers and my body, I tried to kill him. His mother died in an attempt to save him—and unwittingly provided him with a protection I admit I had not foreseen…I could not touch the boy…His mother left upon him the traces of her sacrifice…This is old magic…”

I’ll never know that feeling again, I remember Borders Books had these stacks of flyers that listed reason why Snape may or may not be evil. I read through it with my mom and argued over it.  Every book that came out we had to go to the bookstore and wait in line for *ages*! I’d read the new book, and then 10 more times immediately to look for things I missed. 

I remember reading book 6 and having that “OH SHIT!” Moment when the locket was mentioned, dropping the book and running to grab my copy of book 5 where I remembered reading about a locket that wouldn’t open!

I just have a hard time imagining something like Kingsley dueling Yaxley, then Voldemort suddenly giving the ""break time! Go tend to your wounded and bury your dead"" message to all of the fighters, and Kingsley simply stands back to be like, ""Oh yeah, cool. Go on. Catch you later for part two."" It’s not as if this is proper warfare between two armies and a cease fire is declared; it’s a rebellion. The rebels have absolutely no reason to stop fighting just because Voldemort says so. Why are they listening to him?

Now, I could see if the Death Eaters had a way to vanish on the spot—leaving the rebels with no choice but to stop, but you can’t Apparate within Hogwarts or the grounds. That means the Death Eaters would have had to have walked off into the forest to join Voldemort rather unceremoniously. And the rebels just stood back and let them? Did the no-Apparation spell somehow dissolve during warfare and I missed that?

We get no perspective from Harry since he’s in the Shrieking Shack, and by the time he emerges, it’s all quiet and clear, but I can’t help but find myself confused as to how this went down so calmly."

No, that does not mean the writing is crummy. - A *[deus ex machina](https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DeusExMachina)* is a plot device in which a seemingly hopeless situation is resolved abruptly by a newly introduced element that neither the characters nor the reader could have expected.

**Examples of deus ex machina in the Harry Potter series**


 


In the climactic moment of Book 1, Harry appears to be at the mercy of Professor Quirrell and Voldemort, who know he has the Stone. Quirrell moves to seize it from Harry, but when he grabs him, he finds that he cannot bear to touch him. As Dumbledore explains to Harry later, he has been marked by the love and unselfish sacrifice of his mother, a powerful magic that shields him from harm. Some readers may view this as a deus ex machina, as the lasting protection of Lily’s sacrifice is not hinted at prior to this scene, and Dumbledore arrives conveniently at the precise time to save Harry’s life.


 


In Book 2, in the Chamber of Secrets, Harry is once again facing Voldemort alone. Wandless, he seems defenseless against the memory of Tom Riddle and the basilisk that’s still lurking. Suddenly, Riddle is interrupted by Fawkes, who has arrived to bring Harry the Sorting Hat. The phoenix blinds the basilisk, but Harry, still in danger, desperately puts the Hat on without an inkling of what it could provide. It turns out that the sword of Gryffindor can be pulled out of the Hat by a “true Gryffindor”, which Dumbledore later reveals; Harry slays the basilisk with the sword and escapes death once again. While Fawkes is introduced to the reader in an earlier chapter, the sword is not, and it’s not explained how Fawkes found Harry at the right time in a location previously unknown. This too could be considered a deus ex machina.


 


In Book 4, at the graveyard, Harry is compelled to duel a newly restored Voldemort. Outmatched, Harry accepts that he will die but resolves to face his killer head-on instead of cowering behind a gravestone. The spells of Voldemort and Harry meet in midair, and their duel is interrupted by Priori Incantatem, the reverse spell effect. While the mundane use of Priori Incantatem is introduced earlier in the book, the effect between Harry and Voldemort’s wands is explained afterwards to be different and much more rare, owing to their shared cores. The apparitions of past victims produced by Voldemort’s wand speak with Harry and cause a distraction for Voldemort, long enough for Harry to get away. Once again Harry escapes because of a newly introduced magical effect.


 


**Isn’t the use of deus ex machina kind of a cop out?**


 


No, and here’s why. Each volume isn’t standalone, but part of a series. Harry’s character development continues all the way to the end of *Deathly Hallows*, and his confrontations with Voldemort all provide lessons for Harry that pay off in the last book. In this sense, Harry’s improbable escapes from death are less so examples of lazy writing, and instead a way to show Harry’s growth as a character. Don’t think of the endings of each book as a finale, but rather as trials that lay the groundwork for a final confrontation. Consider how Harry’s agency increases in the climactic moment with each book:


 


As a first-year, Harry is still a child, and is saved by the residual magic of his mother.


 


As a second-year, Harry is given the tools (Fawkes, the Hat, the sword) to succeed by a mentor.


 


As a third-year, Harry thinks at first that he needs a parent (his father) to save him from the dementors, but he realizes he must cast the Patronus himself. The training wheels are coming off.


 


As a fourth-year, Harry gains many new skills in the Tournament, but is in way over his head at the graveyard. Still, he displays incredible bravery and escapes using a learned skill (*”Accio, portkey”*).


 


As a fifth-year, Harry willingly goes into battle leading a team of his friends, but it’s reckless and desperate and ends in disaster.


 


As a sixth-year, Harry acts more as an equal partner with Dumbledore, performing essential tasks in the cave. He forewarns his friends about Malfoy, and his shrewd distribution of the lucky potion probably saved some of their lives. 


 


As a seventh-year, Harry comes into his own, using all the lessons taught to him. He is first hunted, then hunter. Look at how he speaks to Voldemort in the Great Hall, calling him by his childhood name, chastising him as a parent would, and expressing total control of the situation.


 


Harry’s ass being saved in a *deus ex machina* makes perfect sense for the early books, because he’s literally still a child, new to the wizarding world, and in way over his head. As he matures, Harry relies less and less on others to save him, and by the end he is in the driver’s seat."
956,1682353469.0,HarryPotterBooks,"""The greatest Dark sorcerer of all time, Lord Voldemort"" - From Chapter 1 in CoS:

>At the age of one year old, Harry had somehow survived a curse from **the greatest Dark sorcerer of all time, Lord Voldemort**, whose name most witches and wizards still feared to speak.

How much weight should we really give to this statement? It’s mentioned often in power scaling discussion. 

Voldemort is extremely dangerous, powerful and violent, and his ""knowledge of magic is perhaps more extensive than any wizard alive"" (OotP). He’s fixated on Dark Magic, but very well-rounded. I won’t dispute that.

My impression is that, his megalomania aside, Voldemort considers himself the greatest wizard of all time, because he’s the greatest Dark wizard of all time; and he finds Dark Magic superior to other kinds of magic. While Dark Magic is a broad subject, few wizards intentionally dabble in it. Out of those who do, few go into great depth. I think Voldemort’s high specialization in Dark magic is a rather unique case--too unique to be compared. Although it’s worth mentioning, it doesn’t carry much value in, well, power scaling."
957,1682342937.0,HarryPotterBooks,"Magic without wands - I think it's kinda absurd that in Harry Potter's Universe, wizards can only do magic with their wands. When Draco disarmed Dumbledore, he says something like ""i don't have my wand at the moment... i can't defend myself"".

I think it's acceptable that Wizard's culture evolved so that wands became the main catalyst-instrument to use magic. But this should not mean that they can do nothing without wands, or that they can not use other magical instruments (staffs, scepters, other weapons), right? Maybe they don't use staffs (for example) because wands are more practical, and because they would feel like a muggle using a cloak instead of a jacket (cultural reason).

And can you remind me why wizards can use magic without a wand when they are children (even if they don't control it), but they can't do that when they are older? I don't remember if they explain this in the books"

\- What would Alastor see if he could see trough a recipient that contained a Boggart ?

\- If Alastor can see trough wood, does this means that he never sees wood ?

I heard someone on twitter saying "" Ginny fell first but Harry felt harder "" which i think it is nonsense and overshadows Ginny fellings and love for Harry and say this why :

1- Ginny herself said she never gave up on Harry and always had hope and just started do go out and see other peeople thanks to Hermione advise and start be herself around Harry .

2- The books are from Harry pov of course we know more about his fellings and thoughts about other people , his views and opinions etc . If the books were from Ginny pov or JK wrote her pov we would knew the details about her fellings for Harry .

3 - the love and dreams and the thoughts Harry had about Ginny specially in book 6 and 7, Ginny most likely had the same thing for him specially dreams of been with Harry intimite and missing him when he was out with Ron and Hermione during the horcrux haunt .

Many say she's perfect for Harry ( which is true) but people forget how perfect Harry is for Ginny and how much she loves him and that is a really underrated thing for even Hinny shipers talking about Ginny fellings for Harry and how much she loves him and he is her soulmate nad her best source of happiness and hang out"

I assume the logic was that it would let Harry know when Scrimgeour spoke to him that she was still in her same job despite all she did at Hogwarts.

We are told that Voldemort was still unaware about the connection between him and Harry at that point in time but the more I think about it, the more I feel that he was aware and was luring Harry and the others to think that he was unaware about the connection and that he didn’t want anybody to know about the attack on Mr. Weasley but in reality he wanted Harry to see it, he wanted Harry to save Mr. Weasley so that he could make sure Harry would be tempted to not close off his brain, so that he could misuse the connection later on (which we all know he did)."

Her logic (in Harry's mind) is that she is desperate to save Draco from the fighting and wants Voldemort to return peacefully to the castle as part of the conquering army. But surely this was a rather short-sighted plan? Did she really think Voldemort would show mercy once it became obvious to everyone that Harry was still alive, or was she that confident he would lose? Just seems unnecessarily risky.

Surely it would have been way smarter for her to Stun Harry after confirming Draco's safety with him, inform Voldemort that he's still alive, then they would have been able to kill him some other way and she gets what she wants anyway (if not doubly rewarded)."

Do you think this is because he truly harbours affection for Lucius, even though he symbolises everything Snape turned away from (anti muggle sentiment, blood purity craze)? I always considered his relationship with the Malfoys a remnant from their Death Eater days. Snape looked up to Lucius once, he still is partial to Draco because of Slytherin loyalty, but I can't really see Snape truly liking them. They are too much like James Potter (popular bullies) for that imo. What do you think that movement meant?"

By the time Ron comes back, he can genuinely tell him, no sour grapes or justifications, how happy he is Ron got it, and that Ron deserved it!

Through favoring Draco, he would appease Lucius, and therefore, Voldemort. Personally, I think Snape actually loathed Draco. He hated Harry for looking like James Potter, so I think he would despise Draco even more because he ACTED like James Potter.  

He halped him in HBP because he was pressured by Bellatrix Lestrange and Albus Dumbledore, who coincedentally both wanted the same thing-for Snape to kill Dumbledore instead of Draco.

He’s got so many people who care about him to look out for him! Why would he want such a flawed person like myself try to be close to him when he’s got all these other people?”

It’s like the bystander effect:  
When an emergency happens and no one calls for help because other people are present.

Sirius was the closest to what Harry needed, but before Sirius could really heal, bring himself to get to know Harry, and mature to meet Harry’s  needs, he died. Molly also came close to being what Harry needed but she was never really close to him. Dumbledore was so scared of screwing up the lives of the people he cared about again, that he self-isolated to the detriment of those people, including Harry. Lupin did a similar thing, trying to keep others away even when it hurt them, including Harry.

How much warmer would Harry’s life have been if all these people who cared about him weren’t so worried about not being good enough for him?

977,1682005986.0,HarryPotterBooks,"Some general musings on Harry’s maternal gparents - What kind of household do you think they ran? Was it competitive? Did they encourage love and forgiveness between their daughters? Or did they unintentionally favor one and possibly emotionally neglect the other? Did they set a good example of how to be a good productive moral person, even if you were non-magical? Or did they put all magic on a pedestal? 

They produced two very different daughters. One was steadfast in her kindness and empathy for others, whether or not she was a witch. The other became hateful and spiteful by jealousy, but she likely wasn’t always that way (people aren’t born hateful). Children can sense when a parent favors one child over the other (even if its accidental). 

Petunia’s hatred for all things magic came out of her unfathomable jealousy of her sister. So envious that she couldn’t even show kindness and love to Lily anymore, and created a wall to try to block out all awareness of the magical world from her life. 

If the Evanses had shown more love and encouragement in Petunia to develop her own talents in something she was naturally good at and shine in her own right, would her hurt heart not have turned into a stone of envy? And would this extreme form of sibling rivalry, from an older sibling being shown up by the younger, never have manifested?

1. Petunia, as Lily's sister, knew Hogwarts is a boarding school, therefore this would be a perfect opportunity to get rid of Harry for the entire school year.
2. Wizards graduate Hogwarts at the age of 17, so it is earlier than Muggles graduating their schools. From what I've read about British schools, they end mandatory education at the age of 19, so Dursleys would get rid of Harry completely two years earlier. What's more, during and after his learning in Hogwarts, Harry would have had only wizarding education and relationships with people (both formal like with teachers and informal like with Weasleys or Hermione) in a sensible level, so he would disappear from Dursleys and their muggle world completely.

984,1681800658.0,HarryPotterBooks,"Unpopular opinion: Marauders friendship was kinda shitty - I think a lot of people have a pretty glorified picture of Marauders and their bond. This post will explain why I don't share that view.  I think all the Marauders were interesting characters, but deeply flawed and so was their friendship.

Even in their teenage years when they were supposed to have a deep bond they were the type of group I would never want to be a part of. Sirius seemed to bring out the worst in James, Lupin spend a lot of time being too afraid to say anything and Peter was seen lesser than the others. Sure they had great adventures and they helped out Lupin, but seeing a glimpse of their everyday life just seemed really toxic.

It also seems that their friendship was already over before Peter's betrayal. I think that had a part in the reason why Peter was so willing to betray all of them. Peter was a horrible human being, but he wasn't always a coward. As a kid he was willing to became animagus for Lupin despite the fact that it can go horribly and irreversibly wrong. He took the biggest risk of them all because he wasn't nearly as talented as the others. He went from that to a person who sells out his best friends. Those events were just few years apart. 

I think having your friends looking down on you all those years had some impact on why he changed. Sirius making him a secret keeper because no one would ever believe they would choose someone like him might have been the last nail in the coffin.

Other reason why I think they weren't really friends anymore is Sirius and Lupin. They knew someone was spying on them and Sirius was convinced it was Lupin. There's a chance that James believed that too since he didn't tell Lupin where they were hiding. 

But Lupin was just as quick to believe that Sirius was capable of betraying James and becoming a mass murderer. Imagine if all of this would've happened to the golden trio; they would've fight until their last breath to get their best friend out of Azkaban, because there's no way they would ever believe some of them would be capable of doing something so horrible. 

I'm convinced there was much more bad blood between all of them than is directly stated in the books, but I'm also interested to hear all of your views about them.

ETA: Someone made a great point in the comments and it argues my pov better than anything I wrote here. Sirius sent Snape after Lupin during a full moon just because Snape annoyed him and by doing so he almost ruined Lupin's life. There was just two possible out comes from this; either Sirius outs Lupin as a werewolf or makes him a killer. That's something you do to an enemy, not to a friend."
985,1681793881.0,HarryPotterBooks,"The scene in DH with Arthur's patronus is useful to get some insights on how much the locket & circumstances affected the Trio - I find it interesting to compare the scene where Arthur's patronus informs trio that the family is safe and the scene where Ron left the tent. The scenes show the reader how much the locket, fear, uncertainty and starvation affected them. 

**A bit of background:** Before both the scenes, Ron doesn't explicitly show his worries about his family. But he gets really agitated whenever Harry's scar hurts, both dreading and wanting to hear news of his family. However, in the first scene Harry just feels ""badgered, confused"" but later he thinks irritably that ""I am not a tv, can't tune in to whatever I fancy""

**Then news arrives:** Ron has the most intense reaction out of them in both scenes, and one obvious difference is that one news was positive and the other not so. But more importantly, in the first scene Hermione was immediately beside him, gripping his hand and hugging him. In the tent scene however, she's too overwhelmed to think how Ron might be feeling or even worry about Ginny that much. The mission is all that's occupying her thoughts. 

**Ron's behaviour after the news:** In the first scene, Ron starts to apologise to Harry while hugging Hermione. Perhaps he understands that he made Harry feel guilty about Ron's family or he doesn't want to burden Harry with his emotional baggage. In the tent scene, he does exactly the opposite. He tells Harry he doesn't have a plan and knows nothing (something Harry was already feeling bad about). He wants Harry to feel guilty; he is looking for a fight. 

**Harry's response:** In the first scene, Harry doesn't even let Ron complete his apology. He knows there isn't need for any and empathises with Ron's worries for his family. Cut to the tent, he is even refusing to consider that the locket is making Ron's behaviour much more unpleasant. Instead of empathising with Ron, he now insults Ron, saying things like ""did you think you'd be with Mummy before Christmas?"" He too wants the fight. 

And obviously, the conclusion to both scenes is drastically different.

987,1681726862.0,HarryPotterBooks,The abandoning of children is something Harry feels very strongly about - We see this most clearly with his rather harsh reaction to Lupin when Lupin talks about leaving behind his child and coming with them. Another example is when Dumbledore told him about Merope giving  up on living and Harry’s response is she wouldn’t stay alive for her own son and says she had a choice unlike my mother. Dumbledore tells him not to judge her harshly. I think as he grew up an orphan he instantly sympathises with these children who would grow up without their parents. However he knows his parents died to protect him and I think this limits the empathy he can feel for Lupin or Merope as he sees them as having a choice in this that his parents didn’t.
